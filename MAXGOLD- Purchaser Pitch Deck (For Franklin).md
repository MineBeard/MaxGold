## SLIDE 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### We Operate The Mine. We Produce The Gold. We Issue The Token.

**The Problem with Digital Gold Today:**

Existing gold tokens (PAXG, Tether Gold) buy gold at market price and tokenize it. Zero production margin. No differentiation. No upside beyond gold price appreciation.

**Our Advantage:**

We operate a Colorado gold mine with documented reserves exceeding $1.4 billion. Our cost structure allows us to do things competitors literally cannot afford to do.

**1 MXGD = 1.0 Grams .9999 Fine Gold**  
(Growing to 1.10+ grams over time through mine production allocation)

**Raising:** $500,000 minimum to $50,000,000 maximum via SAFT  
**SAFT Offering Period:** 180 days  
**Discount:** 5% flat discount on first $50M raised  
**Minimum Purchase:** $10,000  
**Token Delivery:** 1 week after raising $500,000 minimum

**Current Gold Price:** ~$4,275/oz (~$137.46/gram)  
**Your SAFT Price:** ~$130.60/gram (5% discount)

---

## SLIDE 2: WHY THIS WORKS (And Why Competitors Can't Copy It)

### The Economics Are Simple

**Competitor Model (PAXG, XAUT):**
- Buy gold at market: $137.46/gram
- Tokenize it
- Sell token at: $137.46/gram  
- **Margin: ~0%** (revenue from fees only)
- **Cannot offer discounts**
- **Cannot over-collateralize**
- **No geological backstop**

**Our Model:**
- Mine gold from our mine and have it refined locally
- Tokenize it
- Sell token at: $130.60/gram (5% discount to purchasers)
- **Sustainable margin structure**
- **Can offer SAFT discounts**
- **Can build reserves over time**
- **Geological reserves as ultimate backstop**

**This production advantage enables:**
- Upfront discounts for SAFT purchasers (5%)
- Building reserves over time through production allocation
- Token holder value appreciation as backing ratio grows
- Arbitrage protection once reserves reach 1.10:1

**Competitors cannot replicate this model. They don't control the supply chain. Their margins are low and rely on fees.**

**We take the gold from the earth at over 80% gross profit margin, all in. That's the entire moat.**

## SLIDE 3: THE MINE - COLORADO GOLD DISTRICT

### Clay County Mine & Black Eagle Mill - Colorado

**Location:** Central City Mining District, Gilpin County, 30 miles west of Denver - Historically known as the richest square mile on earth
**Operator:** BioMilling LLC (30-year mineral rights lease)  
**Type:** Hard rock vein mining + historical tailings reprocessing

**Documented Reserves:**

Based on 1980s independent geological drilling programs:

- 530,100+ tons documented  
- Conservative estimate: 0.6 oz/ton traditional recovery  
- **Total: ~318,000 oz documented in ground**  
- Gross value at current prices: **~$1.4 billion**

**Current Status:**

- Mine is accessible and cleared
- Black Eagle Mill on-site (rehabilitation underway)
- Historical production: Significant gold production was done (around ~%600,000 at $20 per ounce) - BUT they only mined the top
layer because technology was not around at the time. (1891-1917)
- Deeper sections remain largely unmined (upside potential)

**Why Colorado?**

✓ Politically stable (U.S. jurisdiction)  
✓ Established mining district (permitting straightforward)  
✓ Excellent infrastructure (30 miles from Denver)  
✓ Proven geology (100+ years of gold and silver mining history)  
✓ Modern mining regulations (environmental compliance)

**This is a real, producing asset. Not a speculative exploration play.**

---

## SLIDE 4: THE "PRODUCTION-BACKED RESERVE" MODEL

### This Is Different From Every Other Gold Token

**The Standard Model PaxGold and TetherAU (the major competitors):**

- 1 token = 1 gram forever
- They buy gold, they store gold, you redeem 1:1
- No differentiation, no premium, price = spot gold
- Zero value creation beyond gold price appreciation

**The MaxGold Model - Mine Production Reserve Accumulation:**

We allocate 6.5% of our mine's net gold dore monthly directly to token reserves. This gold is verified by independent refinery receipts and added to backing for ALL token holders.

**The Mechanism:**

- **Years 1-2:** 6.5% of mine production → reserves
- **Years 3-4:** 5.25% and 4.85% respectivelyof mine production → reserves  
- **Years 5+:** Gradual reduction to 4% floor (stabilization)

**How This Creates Value:**

**Example - Year 2:**
- Mine produces: 770 kg gold total
- 6.5% to reserves: 50.05 kg
- This 50.05 kg backs ALL existing tokens proportionally
- **Result: Backing ratio grows from 1.0 toward 1.10:1**

**Year 3+:**
- Production continues
- 5.25% → reserves (diminishing schedule)
- Ratio continues growing toward stabilization target
- **Target stabilization: 1.15:1 to 1.20:1 backing ratio**

**Why This Model Is Superior:**

**100% Transparent:** Refinery receipts are third-party verified proof. Every period, purchasers can see exactly how much gold was produced and how much went to reserves.

**Independent of Token Sales:** If secondary token sales are slow, reserves still grow based on mine production. We control the input (mining), not market conditions.

**Directly Tied to Our Advantage:** This is ONLY possible because we produce gold from a mine. Competitors who buy at market price can't afford to allocate production to reserves.

**Simple to Understand:** "We add a percentage of our mine's gold production to your token's backing" - crystal clear value proposition.

**Creates Long-Term Holder Value:** As ratio grows, every token becomes worth MORE gold. Early purchasers benefit most from this appreciation.

**Diminishing Schedule Reaches Equilibrium:** We don't allocate production forever. The schedule gradually reduces to a sustainable 5% floor, creating a stable long-term backing ratio.

---

## SLIDE 5: THE ANTI-DEATH-SPIRAL MECHANISM

### Once Ratio Hits 1.10:1, Here's What Protects You

**The "Death Spiral" Problem:**

Most tokens (including PAXG) can drop below intrinsic value and stay there. If PAXG trades at $130 but gold is $137.46, there's no natural buying pressure to close the gap. Token holders just suffer the discount.

**Our Solution - Premium Redemption:**

Once backing ratio reaches 1.10:1 (target: Year 3+), purchasers unlock a second redemption path:

**Standard Redemption Path:**
- Redeem 1 MXGD → Receive 1.0 gram gold
- Available from Day 1
- Minimum: 31.1 MXGD (~1 troy oz)
- Fee: 1%

**Premium Redemption Path** (unlocks at 1.10:1 ratio):
- Redeem 1 MXGD → Receive FULL backing (1.10+ grams)
- Only available once ratio ≥ 1.10
- Minimum: 1,000 MXGD
- Fee: 2%

**How This Creates An Arbitrage Floor:**

If MXGD trades at $135 but gold is $137.46:
- Token appears undervalued
- Arbitrageurs can buy at $135
- Redeem via premium path for 1.10 grams
- Value received: 1.10 × $137.46 = $151.21
- Profit: $16.21 per token (minus 2% fee)

**As MXGD drops toward intrinsic value, arbitrageurs step in. Price stabilizes.**

**PAXG cannot do this.** They can't offer 1.10 grams per token - it would cost them $151.21 to provide what they sell for $137.46. They'd lose money on every redemption.

**We can do it because we produce gold, not buy it at market price.**

## SLIDE 6: TOKEN MECHANICS & REDEMPTION

### ERC-20 Standard, Three Backing Tiers, Two Redemption Paths

**Token Specifications:**

- Standard: ERC-20 on Ethereum
- Ticker: MXGD
- Name: MaxGold
- Backing: 1.0 grams initially, growing to 1.10+ over time
- Fineness: .9999 fine gold

**Three-Tier Backing Structure:**

**Tier 1 - Physical Vault Gold:**
- Stored in insured third-party refinery vaults

- Monthly audits

**Tier 2 - Over-Collateralization Reserve:**
- The additional gold above 1:1 ratio (built through mine production allocation)
- Physical gold bars in secure storage
- Enables premium redemption path
- Replenishes Tier 1 if needed (instead of buying gold or gold equivalent at spot)
- Grows predictably based on mine output

**Tier 3 - Mine Reserves (Ultimate Backstop):**
- 318,000+ oz gold documented in the ground right here in Colorado, U.S.A.
- Covers multiple times any shortfall
- Competitors don't have this ability
- Historically known as the richest square mile on earth!

- Minimum: 31.1 MXGD (~1 troy oz equivalent)
- Receive: 1.0 gram per token
- Fee: 1%
- Timeline: Instant (cash) or 30 days (physical gold)
- This is what most people use

**Premium Redemption (Available once ratio ≥ 1.10):**
- Minimum: 1,000 MXGD  
- Receive: Full backing per token (1.10+ grams)
- Fee: 2%
- Timeline: 60 days, physical only
- This is the arbitrage mechanism that protects value

**Smart Contract Security:**

## SLIDE 7: MARKET OPPORTUNITY - 

### $13 Trillion Gold Market, 0.008% Tokenized

**The Market:**

- Total above-ground gold: $13 trillion
- Investment gold: $3 trillion  
- Digital gold tokens: $1.1 billion (0.008% penetration)
- Room to grow: 100-1000x potential
- The reality is there is plenty of very gold rich mines we would acquire when we raise funding goal.

**Direct Competitors:**

**Paxos Gold (PAXG):**
- Market cap: $580M
- Model: Buy gold at spot, tokenize, custody
- Margin: ~0% (revenue from fees)
- Backing: 1:1 forever

**Tether Gold (XAUT):**
- Market cap: $520M  
- Model: Buy gold at spot, tokenize, custody
- Margin: ~0%
- Backing: 1:1 forever

**MaxGold (MXGD):**
- Target: $50M Year 1, $200M Year 2, $500M+ Year 3
- Model: Produce gold at mine, tokenize, growing backing via production allocation
- Sustainable margin structure
- Backing: 1.0 → 1.10+ growing

**What We Offer That They Can't:**

✓ SAFT discounts (5%) - they have zero margin for discounts  
✓ Growing backing ratio - they can't afford over-collateralization  
✓ Arbitrage protection - their 1:1 ratio provides no price floor  
✓ Geological backstop - they have no mine reserves  
✓ Direct production economics - we control the supply chain  

**Market Validation:**

PAXG has been operating since 2019 with zero SEC enforcement action. The commodity-backed token model is proven and accepted. We're simply executing it better with superior economics.

---

## SLIDE 8: COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

### Five Moats That Competitors Cannot Replicate

**1. Production Cost Structure**

We unearth gold from our mine and have it refined. Competitors buy their gold at market price. This fundamental difference enables everything else: discounts, reserve accumulation, value creation.

**2. Geological Reserves**

318,000+ oz documented in ground. Ultimate backstop that provides security no market-purchaser can match. Multi-year production runway.

**3. Growing Backing Ratio**

Mine production allocation model means every token becomes worth MORE gold over time. Competitors stuck at 1:1 forever. Our tokens appreciate independent of gold price.

**4. Arbitrage Protection**

Premium redemption path creates a natural price floor once ratio reaches 1.10:1. Market forces keep token trading near intrinsic value. Competitors have no such mechanism.

**5. First-Mover in Mine-Backed Category**

We're the first gold token issued by an actual gold mine operator. This is a new category with zero competition. By the time anyone tries to copy us, we'll have established network effects and liquidity.

## SLIDE 10: WHY INVEST IN MAXGOLD?

### The Value Proposition For SAFT Purchasers

**Multiple Return Drivers:**

**1. Entry Discount (Immediate):**
- Pay $130.60 for $137.46 worth of gold
- 5% instant discount
- Locked in at SAFT purchase

**2. Gold Price Appreciation (Ongoing):**
- If gold rises from $4,275 to $5,000/oz (17% gain)
- Your tokens rise proportionally
- Plus you started with 5% discount

**3. Backing Ratio Growth (Years 1-4):**
- Start at 1.0:1 backing
- Grow to 1.10:1+ through production allocation
- Your token becomes worth MORE gold
- 10% value increase from ratio growth alone

**4. Premium Redemption Upside (Year 3+):**
- Unlock ability to redeem full backing (1.10+ grams)
- Creates arbitrage floor protecting downside
- Competition has no equivalent mechanism

**Expected Returns:**

- **Conservative (gold flat):** 8-10% from discount + ratio growth
- **Base Case (gold +15%):** 25-35% over 3 years  
- **Bull Case (gold +40%):** 60-70% over 5 years

**Compared To Alternatives:**

- **Buying PAXG:** 0-15% (gold price only, no discount, no ratio growth)
- **Buying physical gold:** 0-15% (gold price only, minus storage costs)
- **Buying gold miners:** -30% to +100% (extreme volatility, operational risk)
- **Buying MXGD:** 8-70% (multiple return drivers, downside protected)

**Risk-Adjusted Profile:**

This is a commodity play with equity-like upside. You're buying gold at a discount with built-in appreciation mechanisms. Downside is protected by physical gold backing. Upside is enhanced by production allocation and growing reserves.

## SLIDE 11: LEGAL STRUCTURE & RISK MITIGATION

### Why This Is A Commodity Token, Not A Security

**Corporate Structure:**

BioMilling LLC (U.S.)  
├─ Operates Clay County Mine & Black Eagle Mill  
└─ Produces gold for MaxGold

MaxGold LLC (U.S.)  
├─ Issues MXGD tokens  
├─ Manages gold reserves  
└─ Handles token operations and redemptions

**Token holders own GOLD (commodity), not equity in either company**

**Commodity Classification - 5 Layer Defense:**

**1. Physical Delivery Rights:**
- Every token redeemable for physical gold gold equivalent (Ex. TetherAU)
- Not cash-only (that would indicate security)
- Redemption available from launch
- No restrictions on redemption timing

**2. No Profit Expectations From Management Efforts:**
- Token tracks commodity (gold spot price)
- Backing ratio grows from MINE PRODUCTION, not management skill
- Production allocation is mechanical and transparent (refinery receipts)
- Standard commodity dynamics

**3. Functional Use From Day 1:**
- Primary use: Own gold digitally
- Trade, store, transfer gold 24/7
- Redeem for physical when desired
- Use in DeFi as collateral
- Not speculative investment vehicle

**4. Precedent:**
- PAXG: Not deemed security by SEC (operating since 2019)
- XAUT: Same (operating since 2020)
- No enforcement actions against gold-backed tokens
- Established regulatory acceptance

**5. Howey Test Fails:**
- Investment of money? ✓ Yes (purchasers buy token)
- Common enterprise? ✗ No (they own their specific gold, no pooling)
- Expectation of profit? ✗ From gold price, not our efforts
- Derived from efforts of others? ✗ They benefit from holding commodity

**Additional Protections:**

- No staking, no yield, no dividends (those would be security features)
- No governance rights initially (DAO considered for Year 3+)
- Launch via Regulation S (offshore first approach)
- SAFT structure for pre-launch sales (SEC-accepted standard)

**Comparison to PAXG:**

We're structurally identical to PAXG with one key difference: growing backing ratio through mine production allocation. That difference makes us MORE like a commodity (more gold = more commodity backing), not less.

**Risk Acknowledgment:**

SEC could disagree with our classification. If they deem MXGD a security:
- We can register as security (Reg A+ available)
- Costs ~$500K and 6 months delay
- Doesn't kill business, just adds friction
- PAXG/XAUT precedent strongly in our favor

## SLIDE 12: RISKS & HONEST DISCLOSURE

### What Could Go Wrong & How We Mitigate

**Market Risks:**

⚠️ **Gold price could decline**
- Current: $4,275/oz (near all-time highs)
- History: Can drop 30%+ in bear markets
- Mitigation: Token tracks commodity (not leveraged position)
- Mitigation: Growing backing ratio provides cushion
- Impact: Token value falls with gold, but relative to competitors we maintain advantages

⚠️ **Low liquidity in early stages**
- First 6 months: Limited DEX trading only
- Mitigation: Initial liquidity provision
- Mitigation: Market maker partnerships
- Mitigation: Exchange listings as business scales
- Impact: Wider bid-ask spreads early, normalizes over time

**Regulatory Risks:**

⚠️ **SEC could deem MXGD a security**
- Risk: Despite strong commodity case, regulators could disagree
- Mitigation: 5-layer legal defense (see previous slide)
- Mitigation: PAXG/XAUT precedent strongly favors us
- Mitigation: Can register as security if forced (Reg A+)
- Impact: Delays, legal costs, doesn't kill business

⚠️ **Mining regulations could change**
- Risk: Colorado could change mining regulations
- Mitigation: Established mining district (regulations stable since 1800s)
- Mitigation: Not new mine (restarting existing operation)
- Mitigation: Strong relationships with state regulators
- Impact: Could increase costs, unlikely to prevent operations

**Operational Risks:**

⚠️ **Production could disappoint**
- Risk: Mine production lower than expected
- Mitigation: Conservative 0.6 oz/ton estimates (historical grades higher)
- Mitigation: 530,100 tons documented reserves (decades of inventory)

- Impact: Slower token issuance, model still works at lower volumes

⚠️ **Smart contract vulnerabilities**
- Risk: Code bugs could compromise funds
- Mitigation: Professional security audit
- Mitigation: Multi-sig controls, emergency pause function
- Mitigation: Based on battle-tested code (PAXG/USDC standards)
- Impact: Could lose funds if exploited, insurance partially covers

**Custody Risks:**

⚠️ **Third-party vault risk**
- Risk: Vault provider could fail or lose gold
- Mitigation: Lloyd's insurance coverage
- Mitigation: Monthly independent audits
- Mitigation: Diversification across multiple secure locations
- Impact: If vault fails, insurance covers loss

**Competitive Risks:**

⚠️ **Competitors could copy model**
- Risk: Other mines could launch similar tokens
- Mitigation: First-mover advantage in mine-backed category
- Mitigation: Established liquidity and network effects
- Mitigation: Production cost structure is our moat
- Impact: Competition validates market, we maintain advantages

## SLIDE 15: CLOSING

### This Only Works Because We Operate The Mine

**The entire model rests on one fact:**

We produce gold from a mine with documented reserves. Competitors buy at market price. This fundamental difference enables everything: discounts, reserve accumulation, arbitrage protection, and value creation.

**PAXG cannot copy this. Tether Gold cannot copy this.**

They don't operate mines. They buy at market price. They have zero production margin. They're stuck at 1:1 forever with no ability to offer discounts or build reserves.

**This is the first and only mine-operated gold token with growing reserves.**

**Limited to $50M. Offering period: 180 days maximum.**

**Minimum purchase: $10,000**

**This is your opportunity to enter at the ground floor of a new category.**

---

## APPENDIX A: KEY TERMS

**SAFT** - Simple Agreement for Future Tokens. Industry standard for pre-launch token sales to qualified purchasers.

**Over-Collateralization** - Backing each token with more than 1:1 gold. We build this gradually through mine production allocation over time.

**Premium Redemption** - Redeem for full backing (1.10+ grams) vs standard redemption (1.0 gram). Creates arbitrage floor protecting token value.

**Mine Production Allocation** - Using a percentage of actual mine output (verified by refinery receipts) to increase backing reserves. Increases backing ratio for all token holders proportionally.

**Three-Tier Backing** - Physical vault gold (Tier 1) + Reserve gold above 1:1 (Tier 2) + Mine reserves in ground (Tier 3).

**Doré** - Semi-pure gold bars from mine (90-95% purity) before final refining to .9999 fine.

**Graduated Over-Collateralization** - Start at 1:1, build to 1.10+ over time through production allocation. Different from instant over-collateralization.

**Documented Reserves** - Reserves identified through historical geological work and drilling programs. Conservative estimates based on available data.
