## SLIDE 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### **MAXGOLD: U.S. Mine-Backed Gold Tokens**

**The Opportunity:**
Gold at all-time high ($4,320/oz). We own a $1.5B gold mine. We're tokenizing production on Ethereum blockchain.

**1 MXGD = 1 Gram .9999 Fine Gold**
‚úì Redeemable for physical gold or cash  
‚úì 24/7 trading on blockchain  
‚úì Backed by proven U.S. reserves  

**Raising:** $50 Million via SAFT  
**Price:** $132/MXGD (5% discount to $139 spot)  
**Minimum:** $250,000  

**First $25M Committed:** Additional 2% discount ($129/MXGD)  
**Total Early Investor Discount:** 7% below market  

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### **Traditional Gold Ownership is Broken**

**Physical Gold:**
‚ùå Storage fees: 0.5-1% annually  
‚ùå High minimums: 400oz bars = $1.7M  
‚ùå Illiquid: Days/weeks to sell  
‚ùå Geographic constraints  
‚ùå No composability (can't use in DeFi)  

**Gold ETFs (GLD, IAU):**
‚ùå Management fees: 0.4% annually  
‚ùå Market hours only (not 24/7)  
‚ùå Counterparty risk  
‚ùå No redemption rights  
‚ùå Cannot use as collateral  

**Digital Gold (PAXG, XAUT):**
‚ùå Buy gold at market ($4,320/oz) - zero margin  
‚ùå Centralized control (single company risk)  
‚ùå Limited transparency  
‚ùå No direct mine ownership  

**The Gap:** No one has tokenized gold production from a mine-owner perspective.

## SLIDE 4: THE MINE

### **BioMilling LLC - U.S. Gold Mine**

**Location:** Colorado, U.S.
**Type:** Hard rock + placer deposits  
**Proven Reserves:** $1.5 Billion  
  - At $4,320/oz gold price  
  - Updated geological survey (2025)  
  - 347,222 oz gold in ground  
  - Conservative estimate (likely higher)  

**Current Status:**
‚ö†Ô∏è Mine currently offline (previous owner capital constraints)  
‚úÖ All permits active  
‚úÖ Infrastructure in place  
‚úÖ Equipment on-site  
‚úÖ Proven geology  

**Restart Timeline with SAFT Funding:**
- **Month 1-2:** Hire mining crew ($2M)
- **Month 2-3:** Equipment overhaul ($3M)
- **Month 3-4:** BioMilling setup ($6M)
- **Month 4:** First gold dor√© production
- **Month 6:** Full-scale operations (500kg/year)
- **Year 2:** Scaled production (2,000kg/year)

**Why This Is Actually GOOD for Investors:**

Traditional mining company:
- Producing mine = hard to justify capital raise
- Dilutive equity financing
- Lower returns

MaxGold:
- Mine ready to restart = perfect time for non-dilutive token financing
- SAFT proceeds bring mine online
- Token holders get gold at production cost
- No equity dilution for mine owners
- Clear use of funds

## SLIDE 5: BIOMILLING TECHNOLOGY

### **Revolutionary Gold Extraction**

**The Industry Problem:**
Conventional mining processes only gold from oxide ores. Sulfide ores (30-40% of gold deposits) require expensive roasting or pressure oxidation. Most mines discard sulfide waste as "uneconomical."

**Our Solution: BioMilling**
Proprietary microbial extraction process that dissolves gold from sulfide ores at ambient temperature and pressure.

**How It Works:**
1. Naturally occurring bacteria (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans)
2. Genetically optimized by our patent partner
3. Bacteria oxidize sulfide minerals
4. Releases gold for conventional cyanide leaching
5. 90-95% recovery rates

**Advantages:**
‚úì Process sulfides conventional methods can't
‚úì Lower energy costs (no roasting required)
‚úì Environmental: No SO2 emissions
‚úì Economic: Unlock "waste" piles worth millions

**Patent Status:**
- Core technology: U.S. Patent PCT/US2021/061860 (partner-owned)
- Exclusive license: BioMilling LLC for U.S.
- Duration: 15 years remaining
- Strategic moat: Competitors need 5-10 years to develop equivalent

**Competitive Advantage:**
1. **Own mine waste:** 50,000 tons sulfide stockpiles = $20M+ gold
2. **Partner with other mines:** Process their waste for 50/50 split
3. **Buy waste piles:** High-grade "trash" becomes treasure

**Comparable Technology:**
- Barrick Gold: Testing bioleaching (5+ years behind)
- Newmont: Pressure oxidation (10x our cost)
- Small miners: Can't afford conventional sulfide processing

**Revenue Potential (B2B):**
If we process just 1% of U.S. sulfide waste stockpiles:
- 500,000 tons @ 3g/ton = 1,500kg gold
- Revenue: $200M+ (at current prices)
- Partner revenue share: 50/50 split

## SLIDE 13: RISK FACTORS

### **Honest Disclosure**

**Mine Production Risks:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Mine currently offline** - Not producing (restarting with SAFT funds)
- Mitigation: Proven reserves, existing infrastructure, experienced team
- Timeline: 90 days to first production, 180 days to full scale
- Backup: Can purchase gold on market temporarily if production delays

‚ö†Ô∏è **Production may not meet targets**
- Mitigation: Conservative estimates (500kg Year 1 vs. 1,000kg capacity)
- Backup: Adjust token issuance to match actual production

‚ö†Ô∏è **BioMilling technology unproven at scale**
- Mitigation: Lab-proven, patent-protected, pilot production successful
- Backup: Conventional processing available (higher cost)

**Refinery Risks:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Dependency on refinery partners**
- Mitigation: 3-5 partners (redundancy), established refineries
- Backup: Multiple refinery options within 100 miles

‚ö†Ô∏è **Custody at third-party refineries**
- Mitigation: Lloyd's insurance (110% coverage), monthly audits
- Standard: PAXG uses same model successfully

**Market Risks:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Gold price volatility**
- Current: $4,320/oz (all-time high)
- History: -30% drawdowns possible
- Mitigation: Token tracks commodity (not speculation)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Liquidity risk**
- Early days: Low trading volume
- Mitigation: $3M+ DEX liquidity, market maker partnerships
- Timeline: Improves with exchange listings (Month 4-6)

**Regulatory Risks:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Token classification uncertainty**
- Risk: SEC could deem MXGD a security (despite defenses)
- Mitigation: 5-layer legal defense, top counsel, Regulation S
- Backup: Register as security if forced (Reg A+)

‚ö†Ô∏è **U.S. market access**
- Risk: May not be able to list on U.S. exchanges immediately
- Mitigation: International launch first, U.S. after decentralization
- Timeline: 12-24 months to U.S. market entry

**Technical Risks:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Smart contract vulnerabilities**
- Mitigation: CertiK audit, multi-sig controls, battle-tested code
- Insurance: Considering Nexus Mutual coverage

‚ö†Ô∏è **Ethereum network risk**
- Gas fees, congestion, potential hard forks
- Mitigation: ERC-20 standard (most established), Layer 2 options

**Competitive Risks:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **PAXG/XAUT market dominance**
- Current: 95% market share combined
- Mitigation: Superior product (cost advantage, vertical integration)
- Strategy: Differentiate on production ownership

‚ö†Ô∏è **New entrants**
- Other mines could copy model
- Mitigation: First-mover advantage, BioMilling tech, established liquidity

**Complete Loss Possible:**
Investing in early-stage commodity tokens carries risk of total loss. Only invest what you can afford to lose.
