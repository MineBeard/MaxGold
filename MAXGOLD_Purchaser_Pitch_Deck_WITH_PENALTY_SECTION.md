## SLIDE 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### We Operate The Mine and The Mill. We Produce The Gold. We Issue The Token.

**The Problem with Digital Gold Today:**

Existing gold tokens (PAXG, Tether Gold) buy gold at market price and tokenize it. Zero production margin. No differentiation. No upside beyond gold price appreciation.

**Our Advantage:**

We operate a Colorado gold mine with documented reserves exceeding $1.4 billion. Our cost structure allows us to do things competitors literally cannot afford to do.

**1 MXGD = 1.0 Grams .9999 Fine Gold**  
(Growing to 1.10+ grams over time through mine production allocation)

**Raising:** $500,000 minimum to $50,000,000 maximum via SAFT  
**SAFT Offering Period:** 180 days  
**Discount:** 7% flat discount on first $50M raised  
**Minimum Purchase:** $10,000  
**Token Delivery:** 1 week after raising $500,000 minimum


**Your SAFT Price:** 7% discount to spot LME

---

## SLIDE 2: WHY THIS WORKS (And Why Competitors Can't Copy It)

### The Economics Are Simple

**Competitor Model (PAXG, XAUT):**
- Buy gold at market
- Tokenize it
- Sell token at market
- **Margin: ~0%** (revenue from fees only)
- **Cannot offer discounts**
- **Cannot over-collateralize**
- **No geological backstop**

**Our Model:**
- Mine gold from our mine, mill it, and refine it.
- Tokenize it
- Sell token at: $130.60/gram (5% discount to purchasers)
- **Sustainable margin structure**
- **Can offer SAFT discounts**
- **Can build reserves over time**
- **Geological reserves as ultimate backstop**

**This production advantage enables:**
- Upfront discounts for SAFT purchasers (7%)
- Building reserves over time through production allocation
- Token holder value appreciation as backing ratio grows
- Arbitrage protection once reserves reach 1.10:1

**Competitors cannot replicate this model. They don't control the supply chain. Their margins are low and rely on fees.**

**We are just like a factory selling at a discount, not at retail.**

## SLIDE 3: THE MINE - COLORADO GOLD DISTRICT

### Clay County Mine & Black Eagle Mill - Colorado

**Location:** Central City Mining District, Gilpin County, 30 miles west of Denver - Historically known as the richest square mile on earth
**Operator:** BioMilling LLC (30 plus-year mineral rights lease)  
**Type:** Hard rock vein mining + historical tailings reprocessing

**Documented Reserves:**

Based on independent geological drilling programs:

- 530,100+ tons documented  
- Conservative estimate: 0.5 oz/ton traditional recovery  
- **Total: ~318,000 oz documented in ground**  
- Gross value at current prices: **~$1.34 billion**

**Current Status:**

- Mine is a shovel ready series of hauluage declines
- Black Eagle Mill (renovation underway)
- Significant, documented, and readily accessible supergene gold at portal depth wit multiple
unmined veins at lower levels.


**Why Colorado?**

✓ Politically stable (U.S. jurisdiction)  
✓ Established mining district (permitting straightforward)  
✓ Excellent infrastructure (30 miles from Denver)  
✓ Proven geology (100+ years of gold and silver mining history)  
✓ Modern mining regulations (environmental compliance)

**This is a real, producing asset. Not a speculative exploration play.**

## SLIDE 4: THE "PRODUCTION-BACKED RESERVE" MODEL

### This Is Different From Every Other Gold Token

**The Standard Model PaxGold and TetherAU (the major competitors):**

- 1 token = 1 gram forever
- They buy gold, they store gold, they charge you, and you redeem 1:1
- No differentiation, no premium, price = spot gold
- Zero value creation beyond gold price appreciation

**The MaxGold Model - Mine Production Reserve Accumulation:**

We allocate 6.5% of our mine's net gold dore monthly directly to token reserves. This gold is verified by independent refinery receipts and added to backing for ALL token holders.

**The Mechanism:**

- **Years 1-2:** 6.5% of mine production → reserves
- **Years 3-4:** 5.25% and 4.85% respectivelyof mine production → reserves  
- **Years 5+:** Gradual reduction to 4% floor (stabilization)

**How This Creates Value:**

**Example - Year 2:**
- Mine produces: 770 kg gold total (24,756 Troy ounces)
- 6.5% to reserves: 50.05 kg
- This 50.05 kg backs ALL existing tokens proportionally
- **Result: Backing ratio grows from 1.0 toward 1.10:1**

**Year 3+:**
- Production continues
- 5.25% → reserves (diminishing schedule)
- Ratio continues growing toward stabilization target
- **Target stabilization: 1.15:1 to 1.20:1 backing ratio**

**Why This Model Is Superior:**

**100% Transparent:** Refinery receipts are third-party verified proof. Every period, purchasers can see exactly how much gold was produced and how much went to reserves.

**Independent of Token Sales:** If secondary token sales are slow, reserves still grow based on mine production. We control the input (mining), not market conditions.

**Directly Tied to Our Advantage:** This is ONLY possible because we produce gold from our mine. Competitors who buy at market price can't afford to allocate production to reserves.

**Simple to Understand:** "We add a percentage of our mine's gold production to your token's backing" - crystal clear value proposition.

**Creates Long-Term Holder Value:** As ratio grows, every token becomes worth MORE gold. Early purchasers benefit most from this appreciation.

**Diminishing Schedule Reaches Equilibrium:** We don't allocate production forever. The schedule gradually reduces to a sustainable 4% floor, creating a stable long-term backing ratio.

---

## SLIDE 5: THE ANTI-DEATH-SPIRAL MECHANISM

### Once Ratio Hits 1.10:1, Here's What Protects You

**The "Death Spiral" Problem:**

Most tokens (including PAXG) can drop below intrinsic value and stay there. If PAXG trades at $130 but gold is $137.46, there's no natural buying pressure to close the gap. Token holders just suffer the discount.

**Our Solution - Premium Redemption:**

Once backing ratio reaches 1.10:1 (target: Year 3+), purchasers unlock a second redemption path:

**Standard Redemption Path:**
- Redeem 1 MXGD → Receive 1.0 gram gold 
- Available from Day 1
- Minimum: 310 MXGD (~10 troy oz)
- Fee: 1%

**Premium Redemption Path** (unlocks at 1.10:1 ratio):
- Redeem 1 MXGD → Receive FULL backing (1.10+ grams)
- Only available once ratio ≥ 1.10
- Minimum: 1,000 MXGD
- Fee: 2%

**How This Creates An Arbitrage Floor:**

If MXGD trades at $135 but gold is $137.46:
- Token appears undervalued
- Arbitrageurs can buy at $135
- Redeem via premium path for 1.10 grams
- Value received: 1.10 × $137.46 = $151.21
- Profit: $16.21 per token (minus 2% fee)

**As MXGD drops toward intrinsic value, arbitrageurs step in. Price stabilizes.**

**PAXG cannot do this.** They can't offer 1.10 grams per token - it would cost them $151.21 to provide what they sell for $137.46. They'd lose money on every redemption.

**We can do it because we produce gold, not buy it at market price.**

## SLIDE 6.5: EARLY REDEMPTION PROTECTIONS FOR SAFT HOLDERS

### Protecting Long-Term Value Creation

**The Challenge:**

We're offering SAFT purchasers a 7% discount ($130.60 vs $137.46 spot). Without protections, this creates a risk of short-term arbitrage where purchasers immediately redeem, extract the discount value, and could destabilize the token's market during the critical launch period.

**The Solution: Time-Based Early Redemption Fee Structure**

SAFT holders who redeem tokens for physical gold within the first 6 months after token delivery will pay an additional early redemption fee equal to the discount they received (7%). This fee is IN ADDITION to the standard 1% base redemption fee.

**Fee Schedule (Original SAFT Purchasers Only):**

| Time After Token Delivery | Discount Recovery Fee | Base Redemption Fee | Total Cost |
|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Months 0-6                | 7%                   | 1%                  | 8%         |
| Months 6+                 | 0%                   | 1%                  | 1%         |

**Important Clarifications:**

✓ **Trading is NOT restricted:** SAFT holders may freely sell, transfer, or trade tokens on Uniswap, exchanges, or peer-to-peer at any time without any penalties whatsoever.

✓ **Secondary buyers are exempt:** Anyone who purchases tokens on the open market (Uniswap, centralized exchanges, or from other holders) faces ZERO early redemption penalties, regardless of when they redeem. Only original SAFT purchaser wallet addresses are subject to the 6-month early redemption fee.

✓ **Penalty gold goes to reserves:** All early redemption penalty gold (if any) is permanently added to backing reserves, benefiting ALL token holders proportionally by increasing the backing ratio faster.

✓ **Automatic smart contract enforcement:** Penalties are enforced via immutable smart contract code, not discretionary decisions. The system is transparent, auditable, and cannot be manipulated by the company.

**Why This Protects Your Investment:**

1. **Prevents short-term exploitation:** A purchaser cannot invest $10,000, receive a 7% discount, and immediately redeem for quick profit. The fee structure eliminates this arbitrage opportunity.

2. **Aligns long-term incentives:** SAFT purchasers are economically incentivized to hold for at least 6 months, supporting token price stability during the critical launch and growth period.

3. **Builds reserves faster:** Any penalty gold paid stays in the vault permanently, accelerating the path to the target 1.10:1 backing ratio and benefiting all holders.

4. **Doesn't restrict liquidity:** Purchasers can still exit their position via secondary market sales at any time if needed. The token remains fully liquid and tradeable from Day 1.

**Example: The Real Math**

Someone invests $10,000 in the SAFT at 7% discount:
- Receives: 76.57 MXGD tokens ($10,000 ÷ $130.60)
- Spot value at delivery: $10,528 (76.57 × $137.46)
- Unrealized profit: +$528 (+5.28%)

**Scenario A: They try to redeem in Month 3**
- Early redemption fee: 7%
- Base redemption fee: 1%
- Total cost: 8%
- Gold received: 70.44 grams (92% of 76.57)
- Value at spot: $9,683 (70.44 × $137.46)
- **Result: -$317 loss (-3.2%)** ❌

**Scenario B: They sell on Uniswap in Month 3 instead**
- No penalty (trading is unrestricted)
- Receives market price (~$137/token)
- Value: ~$10,489
- **Result: +$489 profit (+4.9%)** ✓

**Scenario C: They wait until Month 7 to redeem**
- Early redemption fee: 0% (past 6 months)
- Base redemption fee: 1%
- Total cost: 1%
- Gold received: 75.80 grams (99% of 76.57)
- Value at spot: $10,419 (75.80 × $137.46)
- **Result: +$419 profit (+4.2%)** ✓

**Key Takeaway:** The structure prevents gaming the SAFT discount for instant profit via redemption, while maintaining full trading liquidity and allowing profitable exits through secondary markets or after the 6-month period.

**Smart Contract Implementation:**

The penalty system is enforced on-chain via these mechanisms:

1. **SAFT holder tracking:** When tokens are delivered to SAFT purchasers, their wallet addresses are permanently marked as "original SAFT holders" with a timestamp.

2. **Redemption penalty calculation:** When any address requests gold redemption, the smart contract checks:
   - Is this an original SAFT holder address? If NO → 1% base fee only
   - If YES → How many months since token delivery?
   - If < 6 months → Apply 7% early redemption fee + 1% base fee
   - If ≥ 6 months → 1% base fee only

3. **Transfer handling:** When SAFT holders transfer tokens to other addresses, those receiving addresses are NOT marked as SAFT holders. The secondary buyer has zero penalties.

4. **Audit trail:** All redemptions, fees, and penalty gold additions are recorded on-chain in publicly viewable transaction logs.

**Regulatory & Legal Compliance:**

This fee structure is designed to maintain commodity classification rather than security status:

- The fee applies to a specific ACTION (physical redemption), not to ownership or trading
- It functions as a "bulk purchase discount recovery" mechanism common in commodity markets
- Secondary market trading remains unrestricted (critical for commodity classification)
- The mechanism is automated via code, not discretionary management decisions
- All fees are transparently disclosed in SAFT legal agreements

**This is not a lockup, vesting schedule, or trading restriction - it's a redemption fee structure designed to prevent discount arbitrage while maintaining full token liquidity.**

## SLIDE 7: WHY COMPETITORS CAN'T COPY THIS

### The Production Moat

**PAXG's Economics (Competitor):**

**Revenue:**
- Sell 1 token at $137.46 (spot price)

**Costs:**
- Buy 1 gram gold at $137.46 (spot price)
- Storage fees: $0.50/year
- Insurance: $0.30/year
- **Gross Margin: ~$0** (fees only)

**Result:**
- Cannot offer discounts (no margin)
- Cannot over-collateralize (unprofitable)
- Stuck at 1:1 forever
- Revenue from 0.02% custody fees only

---

**MaxGold Economics (Us):**

**Revenue:**
- Sell 1 token at $130.60 (7% SAFT discount)

**Costs:**
- Mine 1 gram gold at ~$32/gram all-in cost
- Refining: $5/gram
- Storage: $0.50/year
- Insurance: $0.30/year
- **Total Cost: ~$38/gram**

**Result:**
- Gross Margin: $92.60/gram (71% margin even with discount)
- Can afford 7% discounts AND over-collateralization
- Can allocate 6.5% production to reserves
- Multiple revenue streams (tokens + redemption fees)

**The Margin Is The Moat:**

Our $92/gram margin enables three things competitors cannot do:

1. **Upfront Discounts:** We can sell at $130.60 and still profit $92.60/gram. PAXG sells at $137.46 and profits $0.

2. **Over-Collateralization:** We can back each token with 1.05-1.10 grams and still be hugely profitable. PAXG cannot afford any over-collateralization.

3. **Reserve Growth:** We allocate 6.5% of mine production to reserves. This costs us $2.40/gram in opportunity cost but creates $8.93 in value for token holders (at spot prices). PAXG has zero production to allocate.

**Why Can't They Copy Us?**

**Option A: PAXG buys a gold mine**
- Requires $50M-$500M+ in capital
- 2-5 year development timeline
- Mining operational complexity (not their expertise)
- Massive execution risk
- Would need to rebuild their entire business model

**Option B: Another mine launches a token**
- Possible, but we have first-mover advantage
- Most mines are debt-financed and can't take on token risk
- Requires crypto expertise + mining expertise (rare combo)
- We'll have established liquidity and network effects

**Competition Will Come Eventually. But Not Before We Establish Market Position.**

By the time competitors launch (18-36 months), we will have:
- $50M+ market cap
- 10,000+ token holders
- Established exchange listings
- Proven production track record
- Network effects and liquidity

**First Mover Advantage Is Real.**

Bitcoin wasn't the first cryptocurrency. It was the first one that worked and achieved network effects. Same principle applies here.

## SLIDE 8: USE OF FUNDS - THREE-TIER OPERATIONAL PLAN

### Flexible Scaling Based on Capital Raised

**Tier 1: Minimum Viable Launch ($500K - $7M)**

**Token Delivery:**
- 1 week after hitting minimum
- Modest initial issuance: 3,828 - 53,593 MXGD tokens
- Immediate Uniswap liquidity pool: $100K-$250K

**Operations:**
- Pilot mill operations (20-40 tons/day)
- Small crew (8-12 staff)
- Begin gold production within 60 days
- Conservative timeline: Black Eagle Mill rehab in 18-24 months

**Use of Funds:**
- 45%: Gold backing purchase (vault gold)
- 35%: Pilot mill equipment and initial operations
- 10%: Smart contract audit and security
- 10%: Legal, insurance, and operating reserves

**Result:** Tokens delivered quickly, production starts conservatively, long runway to full capacity.

---

**Tier 2: Accelerated Growth ($7M - $30M)**

**Token Delivery:**
- 1 week after hitting threshold
- Significant issuance: 53,593 - 229,684 MXGD tokens
- Uniswap liquidity pool: $500K-$1M

**Operations:**
- LEASE OPERATIONAL MILL (within 60 days)
- Accelerate Black Eagle rehab (9-12 months)
- Scale crew to 15-20 staff
- Target production: 75-100 tons/day within 90 days

**Key Difference:**
Instead of waiting 12-18 months to rehab Black Eagle, we lease an already-operational mill in Colorado (several available) and begin processing immediately. Parallel-track Black Eagle rehab while generating revenue.

**Use of Funds:**
- 40%: Gold backing purchase
- 25%: Mill lease (6-12 month agreements)
- 20%: Black Eagle acceleration
- 10%: Expanded liquidity pools and exchange listings
- 5%: Legal, audit, insurance

**Result:** Production within 60-90 days, faster path to 1.10:1 ratio, earlier reserve accumulation.

---

**Tier 3: Full Expansion ($30M - $50M)**

**Token Delivery:**
- 1 week after hitting threshold
- Major issuance: 229,684 - 382,806 MXGD tokens
- Uniswap liquidity pool: $1M-$2M
- Immediate exchange listing push (Coinbase, Kraken)

**Operations:**
- ACQUIRE OPERATIONAL MINE + MILL (within 30-60 days)
- Multiple producing mines available in Colorado for $15M-$25M
- These are turnkey operations currently producing gold
- Immediate production: 100-150 tons/day
- Scale to 200+ tons/day within 6 months

**Key Difference:**
With $30M+, we don't wait to rehab Black Eagle. We BUY a currently-producing operation and hit the ground running. Clay County Mine becomes our expansion/reserve project.

**Use of Funds:**
- 35%: Gold backing purchase
- 40%: Acquire operational mine + mill ($15M-$20M)
- 15%: Clay County/Black Eagle development
- 5%: Major exchange listings and market making
- 5%: Legal, audit, team expansion

**Acquisitions Identified:**
- [Mine A]: 120 tons/day, $18M asking price, 45-day close
- [Mine B]: 80 tons/day + mill, $22M, currently producing
- [Mine C]: 150 tons/day, $25M, includes tailings reprocessing

**Result:** Full-scale production within 60 days, reserve accumulation immediately, 1.10:1 ratio within 12 months instead of 24-36 months.

---

**Timeline Comparison:**

| Milestone | Tier 1 ($500K-$7M) | Tier 2 ($7M-$30M) | Tier 3 ($30M-$50M) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Token Delivery** | Week 1 | Week 1 | Week 1 |
| **First Gold Production** | Month 3-4 | Month 2-3 | Month 1-2 |
| **100 tons/day Capacity** | Month 18-24 | Month 9-12 | Month 2-3 |
| **1.10:1 Backing Ratio** | Year 3-4 | Year 2-3 | Year 1-2 |
| **Major Exchange Listings** | Year 2 | Year 1 | Month 6-9 |

**All three tiers are viable. We execute the plan that matches capital raised.**

The beauty of this structure: We can launch successfully with $500K OR $50M. The timeline adjusts, but the model works at any scale.

## SLIDE 9: LEGAL STRUCTURE - COMMODITY NOT SECURITY

### Five-Layer Defense Against Securities Classification

**Layer 1: SEC April 2025 Covered Stablecoin Guidance**

The SEC issued formal guidance on gold-backed stablecoins in April 2025, providing regulatory clarity:

✓ 1:1 or better physical backing required  
✓ Instant redemption rights for gold or cash  
✓ Third-party custody and insurance  
✓ Monthly independent audits  
✓ No profit-sharing from operations

**MaxGold complies fully with all five requirements.**

**Layer 2: CFTC Commodity Jurisdiction**

Gold is explicitly classified as a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC, not SEC, has primary jurisdiction.

**Howey Test Analysis:**
1. Investment of money? ✓ (Purchaser pays cash)
2. Common enterprise? ✗ (No pooling - each token is separate gold ownership)
3. Expectation of profits? ✗ (Purchaser expects gold price appreciation, not company profits)
4. Efforts of others? ✗ (Company stores gold, doesn't "manage" for returns)

**Failed Howey Test = Not a Security**

**Layer 3: Ripple vs. SEC Precedent (2023)**

The landmark Ripple decision established that programmatic sales of crypto tokens on exchanges are NOT securities offerings.

**Key Holdings:**
- Institutional sales (like SAFT) = securities  
- Programmatic exchange sales = NOT securities  
- Distinction depends on purchaser expectations

**Our Structure:**
- SAFT phase: Complies with Reg D/Reg S (institutional only)
- Post-launch trading: Programmatic sales (not securities)
- Clear separation protects secondary market

**Layer 4: Sufficient Decentralization (Hinman Standard)**

SEC's William Hinman (2018): "If the network is sufficiently decentralized, the digital asset itself may not represent an investment contract."

**Our Decentralization Path:**
- Year 1: Centralized operations (disclosed transparently)
- Year 2: Progressive DAO formation (Wyoming DUNA structure)
- Year 3: Governance token launch, protocol control transfer
- Result: Community-run protocol, not company-controlled security

**Layer 5: Gold Warehouse Receipt Precedent**

Gold warehouse receipts have existed for 150+ years without securities classification. A token representing stored gold is functionally identical to a warehouse receipt.

**Key Elements:**
- Bailment relationship (you own the gold, we store it)
- Redeemable on demand
- No profit expectation from issuer's efforts
- Commodity ownership, not equity stake

**These five layers create overlapping legal protection.**

---

**Regulatory Strategy:**

**Phase 1: International Launch (BVI)**
- British Virgin Islands incorporation
- Regulation S (non-U.S. sales)
- Robust KYC/AML (Sumsub, Chainalysis)
- No U.S. marketing
- 12-month distribution compliance period

**Phase 2: U.S. Market Entry (Post-Decentralization)**
- After 12-24 months of decentralization
- Programmatic sales only (Ripple precedent applies)
- No direct company promotion to U.S. persons
- Community-driven adoption

**Legal Opinions:**

We will obtain comprehensive legal opinions from:
- Securities law counsel (Reg D/Reg S compliance)
- Commodity law counsel (CFTC jurisdiction)
- Token structure counsel (Howey test analysis)

Total legal budget: $300K-$500K

## SLIDE 10: RISK DISCLOSURES

### What Could Go Wrong (And How We Mitigate)

**Market Risks:**

⚠️ **Gold price could crash**
- Risk: If gold drops 50%, token drops 50%
- Reality: You're getting gold exposure - price volatility is inherent
- Mitigation: Over-collateralization provides some cushion
- Historical context: Gold has never gone to zero in 5,000 years

⚠️ **Token could trade below intrinsic value**
- Risk: MXGD at $130 while gold is $137.46
- Mitigation: Arbitrage mechanism (premium redemption)
- Mitigation: Early redemption penalties discourage panic selling
- Reality: Temporary dislocations happen, arbitrageurs close gaps

⚠️ **Low liquidity in early months**
- Risk: Hard to sell large positions quickly
- Mitigation: Initial liquidity provision
- Mitigation: Market maker partnerships
- Mitigation: Exchange listings as business scales
- Impact: Wider bid-ask spreads early, normalizes over time

**Regulatory Risks:**

⚠️ **SEC could deem MXGD a security**
- Risk: Despite strong commodity case, regulators could disagree
- Mitigation: 5-layer legal defense (see previous slide)
- Mitigation: PAXG/XAUT precedent strongly favors us
- Mitigation: Can register as security if forced (Reg A+)
- Impact: Delays, legal costs, doesn't kill business

⚠️ **Mining regulations could change**
- Risk: Colorado could change mining regulations
- Mitigation: Established mining district (regulations stable since 1850s)
- Mitigation: Not new mine or mill (restarting existing operation)
- Mitigation: Strong relationships with state regulators
- Impact: Could increase costs, unlikely to prevent operations

**Operational Risks:**

⚠️ **Production could disappoint**
- Risk: Mine production lower than expected
- Mitigation: Conservative 0.5 oz/ton estimates 
- Mitigation: 530,100 tons documented reserves (decades of inventory)
- Mitigation: Multiple unexplored vein systems (upside potential)
- Impact: Slower token issuance, model still works at lower volumes

⚠️ **Smart contract vulnerabilities**
- Risk: Code bugs could compromise funds
- Mitigation: Professional security audit
- Mitigation: Multi-sig controls, emergency pause function
- Mitigation: Based on battle-tested code (PAXG/USDC standards)
- Impact: Could lose funds if exploited, insurance partially covers

**Custody Risks:**

⚠️ **Third-party vault risk**
- Risk: Vault provider could fail or lose gold
- Mitigation: Lloyd's insurance coverage
- Mitigation: Monthly independent audits
- Mitigation: Diversification across multiple secure locations
- Impact: If vault fails, insurance covers loss

**Competitive Risks:**

⚠️ **Competitors could copy model**
- Risk: Other mines could launch similar tokens
- Mitigation: First-mover advantage in mine-backed category
- Mitigation: Established liquidity and network effects
- Mitigation: Production cost structure is our moat
- Impact: Competition validates market, we maintain advantages

**Reality: This is a commodity play, not risk-free. Only participate with capital you can afford exposure to gold pricing to.**

## SLIDE 15: SUMMARY

### This Only Works Because We Operate The Mine

**The entire model rests on one fact:**

We produce gold from a mine with documented reserves. Competitors buy at market price. This fundamental difference enables everything: discounts, reserve accumulation, arbitrage protection, and value creation.

**PAXG cannot copy this. Tether Gold cannot copy this.**

They don't operate mines. They buy at market price. They have zero production margin. They're stuck at 1:1 forever with no ability to offer discounts or build reserves.

**This is the first and only mine-operated gold token with growing reserves.**

**Limited to $50M. Offering period: 180 days maximum.**

**Minimum purchase: $10,000**

**This is your opportunity to enter at the ground floor of a new category.**

---

## APPENDIX A: KEY TERMS

**SAFT** - Simple Agreement for Future Tokens. Industry standard for pre-launch token sales to qualified purchasers.

**Over-Collateralization** - Backing each token with more than 1:1 gold. We build this gradually through mine production allocation over time.

**Premium Redemption** - Redeem for full backing (1.10+ grams) vs standard redemption (1.0 gram). Creates arbitrage floor protecting token value.

**Mine Production Allocation** - Using a percentage of actual mine output (verified by refinery receipts) to increase backing reserves. Increases backing ratio for all token holders proportionally.

**Three-Tier Backing** - Physical vault gold (Tier 1) + Reserve gold above 1:1 (Tier 2) + Mine reserves in ground (Tier 3).

**Doré** - Semi-pure gold bars from mine (90-95% purity) before final refining to .9999 fine.

**Graduated Over-Collateralization** - Start at 1:1, build to 1.10+ over time through production allocation. Different from instant over-collateralization.

**Documented Reserves** - Reserves identified through historical geological work and drilling programs. Conservative estimates based on available data.

**Early Redemption Fee** - Time-based fee applied to original SAFT purchasers who redeem tokens for physical gold within 6 months of token delivery. Does not apply to trading or secondary market purchases.
