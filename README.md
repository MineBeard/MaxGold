## KEY IMPROVEMENTS FROM V2

### Critical Errors Fixed:

✅ **Production Cost:** $500/oz (was $1,800/oz - massive error)  
✅ **Mine Ownership:** 30-year lease with rights (was "we own")  
✅ **Reserve Numbers:** Conservative documented (was overstated)  
✅ **Timeline:** 12 months realistic (was 6 months aggressive)  
✅ **Over-Collateral:** 10% optimal (was 15% excessive)

### Quality Improvements:

✅ **Terminology:** "Purchaser" not "investor" (commodity status)  
✅ **Pricing:** "Current LME spot" not fixed dollars  
✅ **Claims:** Only defensible facts (removed speculation)  
✅ **Disclosure:** Honest risks (no sugarcoating)  
✅ **Structure:** Clear RED TEXT for founder-only context

---

## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

**V2 Deck:** 3/10 (wrong numbers, unverifiable claims)  
**V3 Deck:** 9/10 (accurate, conservative, defensible)

**What prevents 10/10:**
- Need Franklin's answers on 7 open questions (see FAQ)
- Need to finalize contact information (business line)
- Need final legal counsel review (securities opinion)

**Once these resolved, deck is ready for sophisticated purchasers.**

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR FRANKLIN

**(See Founder FAQ for detailed context)**

1. **Over-Collateralization:** Approve 10% vs 15%?
2. **Contact Info:** Set up MaxGold business line when?
3. **Legal Counsel:** Engage token/securities lawyer now or later?
4. **Audit Firm:** Which Big 4 for reserve audits?
5. **Site Visits:** Offer mine tours to large purchasers?
6. **Timeline:** Is "first close in 2 weeks" realistic?
7. **BioMilling Tech:** Current status of license negotiation?

## THE 10% OVER-COLLATERALIZATION MODEL

### Economic Comparison:

| Model | Cost/Token | Margin | Premium | Advantage |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **15%** | $18.40 | 78% | $16.30 | Bigger premium |
| **10%** | $17.60 | 79% | $12.70 | **Better margins** |

**Recommendation: 10%**

- Saves $0.80 per token ($2.4M on 3M tokens)
- Still creates $12+ arbitrage opportunity
- Still impossible for competitors to copy
- More conservative/defensible legally

**Why it works:**

Our production cost: $16/gram  
PAXG's cost (buying on market): $87/gram  
**Our advantage: $71/gram**

This massive margin enables 10% over-collateral while maintaining 79% gross margins.

PAXG trying to copy would need:
- Buy 1.10 grams at $87 = $95.70 cost
- Sell token at $87 to compete
- **Result: -$8.70 loss per token**

Economically impossible for them. This is the moat.
