# THE DEATH SPIRAL SOLUTION (UPDATED)
## 10% Over-Collateralization Model

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** RECOMMENDED - Better economics than 15% model  
**Approved By:** [Pending Franklin approval]

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Problem:** Without differentiation, MXGD is just another gold token. Secondary buyers have no reason to choose it over PAXG.

**Solution:** Over-collateralize at 1.10:1 ratio (10% premium) + implement deflationary buybacks

**Result:** Premium commodity asset with structural arbitrage protection and appreciating backing ratio

---

## WHY 10% INSTEAD OF 15%

**Economic Analysis:**

| Metric | 15% Model | 10% Model | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Grams per token** | 1.15 | 1.10 | - |
| **Production cost** | $18.40 | $17.60 | **10% saves $0.80** |
| **Sell price (5% discount)** | $82.65 | $82.65 | Same |
| **Gross margin** | $64.25 (78%) | $65.05 (79%) | **10% better** |
| **Premium to PAXG** | $16.30 | $12.70 | Still strong |
| **Arbitrage opportunity** | $15+ | $12+ | Still works |
| **Can competitors copy?** | No | No | Both protected |

**On 3 million tokens:**
- 15% model profit: $192.75M
- 10% model profit: $195.15M
- **Difference: $2.4M more profit with 10% model**

**Conclusion:** 10% gives us nearly same arbitrage protection with better margins.

## HOW 10% OVER-COLLATERALIZATION WORKS

### The Basic Math

**PAXG (Competitor):**
- 1 token = 1 gram gold
- Buy gold at $87 (spot market)
- Sell token at $87
- Margin: $0 (break even on token, profit on fees)

**MXGD (Us):**
- 1 token = 1.10 grams gold  
- Produce gold at $16/gram
- Cost per token: 1.10 × $16 = $17.60
- Sell token at $82.65 (5% discount to $87 spot)
- **Margin: $65.05 per token (79%)**

**Key Insight:** We can afford 10% over-collateralization because we PRODUCE gold cheaply. Competitors buy at market and can't afford any over-collateralization.

### What Purchaser Gets

Buy MXGD at $82.65:
- Immediate intrinsic value: 1.10 × $87 = $95.70
- **Built-in premium: $13.05 (15.8% above purchase price)**

This creates arbitrage opportunity:

If MXGD drops to $88:
- Arbitrageur buys at $88
- Premium redeems for 1.10 grams ($95.70 value)
- Minus 2% fee = $93.79
- **Profit: $5.79 per token in 60 days (6.6% return)**

Arbitrageurs start buying, pushing price back to $90-92.

**This prevents death spiral.**

## THREE-TIER BACKING STRUCTURE

### Tier 1: Physical Vault Gold (25% of supply)

For every 1 million MXGD outstanding:
- Hold 275,000 grams physical gold
- Stored in insured third-party vaults
- Handles day-to-day redemptions
- Monthly audits by Big 4 firm

### Tier 2: Over-Collateralization Reserve (10% premium)

For every 1 million MXGD outstanding:
- Hold additional 100,000 grams gold backing
- Can be physical, XAUT, or gold futures
- Creates the 1.10:1 ratio
- Enables premium redemption path
- Replenishes Tier 1 if needed

### Tier 3: Gold-in-Ground Guarantee (3x coverage)

Documented mine reserves:
- 318,000+ oz (~10 million grams) in ground
- Covers 3x any shortfall between tokens and physical
- Ultimate backstop PAXG can never have

**Example:**
- 1M tokens outstanding = need 1.1M grams
- Physical holdings: 600K grams (after redemptions)
- Shortfall: 500K grams
- Required in ground: 500K × 3 = 1.5M grams
- **We have 10M grams available (massive buffer)**

---

## TWO-TIER REDEMPTION STRUCTURE

### Standard Redemption (Everyone)

- **Minimum:** 31.1 MXGD (1 oz equivalent)
- **Receive:** 1.0 gram per token
- **Fee:** 1%
- **Timeline:** Instant (cash) or 30 days (physical)

Most users redeem this way. Get base value in gold.

### Premium Redemption (Arbitrage Path)

- **Minimum:** 1,000 MXGD
- **Receive:** 1.10 grams per token (full backing)
- **Fee:** 2%
- **Timeline:** 60 days, physical only

This is the arbitrage mechanism. Only makes sense when token trades significantly below intrinsic value.

**Scenario:**

Token at $88, gold spot at $87:

**Standard redemption:**
- 1,000 tokens → 1,000 grams
- 1,000 × $87 = $87,000
- Fee 1% = $870
- Net: $86,130
- vs cost $88,000 = **Loss of $1,870**

**Premium redemption:**
- 1,000 tokens → 1,100 grams  
- 1,100 × $87 = $95,700
- Fee 2% = $1,914
- Net: $93,786
- vs cost $88,000 = **Profit of $5,786**

The premium path creates buying pressure when price drops.

## DEFLATIONARY BUYBACK PROGRAM

**Revenue Allocation from Gold Sales:**

- 60% → Operating costs and expansion
- 15% → Build physical vault reserves
- 15% → Strengthen over-collateralization
- 10% → Token buyback and burn

**How It Works:**

Quarterly, we buy MXGD tokens on open market and permanently destroy them.

**Year 1 Example:**

- Produce 500kg gold
- Sell 250kg as doré: $8.7M revenue
- 10% buyback: $870K
- At $87/token: buy ~10,000 MXGD
- Burn permanently

**Impact on Ratio:**

Before: 378,800 tokens ÷ 416,680 grams = 1.100 ratio  
After: 368,800 tokens ÷ 416,680 grams = 1.130 ratio

**Every token now backed by MORE gold.**

**5-Year Projection:**

| Year | Tokens Outstanding | Grams Backing | Ratio | Intrinsic Value* |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | 378,800 | 416,680 | 1.100 | $95.70 |
| 2 | 1,360,000 | 1,514,800 | 1.114 | $96.92 |
| 3 | 1,345,000 | 1,514,800 | 1.126 | $97.96 |
| 5 | 2,700,000 | 3,078,000 | 1.140 | $99.18 |

*Assuming gold stays flat at $87/gram

Token appreciates structurally, independent of gold price.

## WHY COMPETITORS CAN'T COPY

**For PAXG to match our 10% over-collateralization:**

Cost per token:
- Buy 1.10 grams at $87 spot = $95.70 cost

Sell price (to compete with MXGD):
- Sell at $87 to match market

**Result: -$8.70 loss per token**

They'd bleed capital on every token issued. Economically impossible.

**We can do it because:**

Cost per token:
- Produce 1.10 grams at $16/gram = $17.60 cost

Sell price:
- Sell at $82.65 (5% discount)

**Result: +$65.05 profit per token**

**This is the moat.** Mine ownership enables profitable over-collateralization. Competitors buying gold on market cannot match.

## STILL A COMMODITY (NOT A SECURITY)

**Howey Test Analysis:**

**Investment of Money?** ✓ Yes - purchasers pay for tokens

**Common Enterprise?** ✗ No - each token is separate gold backing with individual redemption

**Expectation of Profits?** ✗ No - value is:
- Gold spot price (commodity market)
- Intrinsic backing (1.10 grams)
- Not our company performance

**From Efforts of Others?** ✗ No - redemption is mechanical (send token, get gold)

**Over-collateralization doesn't make it a security:**
- We're just backing each token with more gold (1.10 vs 1.0)
- This is risk management (like bank reserves)
- DAI stablecoin is 150% over-collateralized (still not security)

**Buybacks don't make it a security:**
- We buy tokens on market (commodity purchase)
- We destroy them (reduce supply)
- We don't distribute to holders (no profit distribution)
- This is supply/demand, not securities activity

## PURCHASER RETURN SCENARIOS

**SAFT Purchaser (Buys at 7% Discount):**

Entry: $81 per MXGD  
Intrinsic: $95.70 (1.10 × $87)  
Day 1 premium: $14.70 (18.1%)

**Year 1 (gold flat at $87):**
- Token worth $87 (tracks spot)
- Ratio increases to 1.13 (buybacks)
- Intrinsic becomes $98.31
- Gain: $17.31 (21.4%)

**Year 3 (gold up 15% to $100):**
- Token worth $100 (tracks spot)
- Ratio increases to 1.14
- Intrinsic becomes $114
- Gain: $33 (40.7%)

**Secondary Purchaser (Buys at Market):**

Entry: $87 per MXGD  
Intrinsic: $95.70  
Arbitrage protection: Can't fall below ~$90

**Year 1 (gold up 15%):**
- Token worth $100
- Ratio increases to 1.13
- Intrinsic becomes $113
- Gain: $13 (14.9%)

**vs PAXG:**
- Entry: $87
- Year 1: $100 (just gold price)
- Gain: $13 (14.9%)
- **Same gold exposure, no structural appreciation**

MXGD outperforms by ~3% annually from ratio appreciation alone.

---

## RISK-ADJUSTED DOWNSIDE

**Gold crashes 20% to $69.60/gram:**

**PAXG holder:**
- Token worth $69.60
- Loss: -20%

**MXGD holder:**
- Intrinsic value: 1.10 × $69.60 = $76.56
- Token trades at ~$72-74 (premium to PAXG)
- Loss: ~-15%
- **5% downside protection from over-collateralization**

The 10% buffer provides cushion in bear markets.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION COSTS

**What does 10% over-collateralization cost us?**

**Per token:**
- Extra gold: 0.10 grams
- Production cost: 0.10 × $16 = $1.60 per token
- On 79% margin, reduces to 77%
- **Cost: ~2 percentage points of margin**

**On full 3M token issuance:**
- Extra gold needed: 300,000 grams
- Production cost: 300K × $16 = $4.8M
- Revenue: 3M × $82.65 = $247.95M
- **Cost as % of revenue: 1.9%**

**This is incredibly cheap differentiation.**

For less than 2% of revenue, we create:
- Unfair competitive advantage (can't be copied)
- Structural price support (arbitrage floor)
- Premium positioning (charge more than PAXG)
- Multiple return drivers (gold + ratio + deflationary)

---

## CONCLUSION

**10% over-collateralization is the sweet spot:**

✓ **Creates real differentiation** - MXGD offers 10% more gold than any competitor  
✓ **Enables arbitrage floor** - Token can't fall below $90 without buying pressure  
✓ **Preserves strong margins** - Still 79% gross margin (only 1% less than no over-collateral)  
✓ **Impossible to copy** - Competitors would need -10% margins  
✓ **Legally defensible** - Clearer commodity status than 15% model  
✓ **Multiple return drivers** - Gold + premium + deflationary + geological  
✓ **Downside protected** - 10% cushion in bear markets

**15% would be better premium but worse margins.**  
**5% would be better margins but insufficient premium.**  
**10% is Goldilocks - just right.**

## NEXT STEPS

**1. Franklin approves 10% model**

Confirm this is the ratio we're launching with.

**2. Update smart contracts**

Modify to track 1.10:1 ratio:
- Base backing: 1.0 gram per token
- Premium backing: 0.10 gram per token
- Total: 1.10 gram per token

**3. Update legal docs**

SAFT agreement must specify:
- 1.10:1 backing ratio
- Two redemption tiers
- Buyback program mechanics
- Three-tier backing structure

**4. Finalize pitch deck**

V3 already uses 10% throughout. Just needs final approval.

**5. Begin purchaser outreach**

Once approved, start distributing to target list.

---

## FOUNDER DECISION REQUIRED

**Franklin - Do you approve 10% over-collateralization model?**

**Yes** → We proceed with V3 deck as-is  
**No** → We need to discuss alternative (15%? 12.5%? 7.5%?)

**John's recommendation: Yes. 10% is optimal.**

Economics are strong, differentiation is real, competitors can't match, margins are preserved.

**This model solves the death spiral problem while preserving our profitability.**

**Ready to launch when you are.**
