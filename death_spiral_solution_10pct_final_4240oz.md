# THE DEATH SPIRAL SOLUTION (UPDATED FOR $4,240/oz SPOT)
## 10% Over-Collateralization Model

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** RECOMMENDED - Better economics than 15% model  
**Approved By:** [Pending Franklin approval]

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Problem:** Without differentiation, MXGD is just another gold token. Secondary buyers have no reason to choose it over PAXG.

**Solution:** Over-collateralize at 1.10:1 ratio (10% premium) + implement deflationary buybacks

**Result:** Premium commodity asset with structural arbitrage protection and appreciating backing ratio

---

## WHY 10% INSTEAD OF 15%

**Economic Analysis (based on $4,240.00/oz ≈ $136.32/gram):**

| Metric | 15% Model | 10% Model | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Grams per token** | 1.15 | 1.10 | - |
| **Production cost** | $18.40 | $17.60 | **10% saves $0.80** |
| **Sell price (5% discount)** | $129.50 | $129.50 | Same |
| **Gross margin** | $111.10 (86%) | $111.90 (86%) | **10% better** |
| **Premium to PAXG** | $20.45 | $13.63 | Still strong |
| **Arbitrage opportunity** | $20.45+ | $13.63+ | Still works |
| **Can competitors copy?** | No | No | Both protected |

**On 3 million tokens:**
- 15% model profit delta vs 10%: **$2,400,000.00 less**
- **Difference: $2,400,000.00 more profit with 10% model**

**Conclusion:** 10% gives us nearly the same arbitrage protection with better margins.

## HOW 10% OVER-COLLATERALIZATION WORKS

### The Basic Math

**PAXG (Competitor):**
- 1 token = 1 gram gold
- Buy gold at ~$136.32 (spot market)
- Sell token at ~$136.32
- Margin: ~$0 (break even on token, profit on fees)

**MXGD (Us):**
- 1 token = 1.10 grams gold  
- Produce gold at ~$16.00/gram (~$500.00/oz)
- Cost per token: 1.10 × $16.00 = $17.60
- Sell token at $129.50 (5% discount to spot ≈ $136.32)
- **Margin: $111.90 (86%)**

**Key Insight:** We can afford 10% over-collateralization because we PRODUCE gold cheaply. Competitors buy at market and can't afford any over-collateralization.

### What Purchaser Gets

Buy MXGD at $129.50:
- Immediate intrinsic value: 1.10 × $136.32 = $149.95
- **Built-in premium: $20.45 (15.8% above purchase price)**

This creates arbitrage opportunity:

If MXGD drops to $138.00:
- Arbitrageur buys at $138.00
- Premium redeems for 1.10 grams ($149.95 value)
- Minus 2% fee ⇒ $146.95
- **Profit: $8.95 per token in ~60 days (6.5% return)**

Arbitrageurs start buying, pushing price back toward ~$141.95–$144.95.

**This prevents death spiral.**

## THREE-TIER BACKING STRUCTURE

### Tier 1: Physical Vault Gold (25% of supply)

For every 1 million MXGD outstanding:
- Hold 275,000 grams physical gold
- Stored in insured third-party vaults
- Handles day-to-day redemptions
- Monthly audits by Big 4 firm

### Tier 2: Over-Collateralization Reserve (10% premium)

For every 1 million MXGD outstanding:
- Hold additional 100,000 grams gold backing
- Can be physical, XAUT, or gold futures
- Creates the 1.10:1 ratio
- Enables premium redemption path
- Replenishes Tier 1 if needed

### Tier 3: Gold-in-Ground Guarantee (3x coverage)

Documented mine reserves:
- 318,000+ oz (~10 million grams) in ground
- Covers 3x any shortfall between tokens and physical
- Ultimate backstop PAXG can never have

**Example:**
- 1M tokens outstanding = need 1.1M grams
- Physical holdings: 600K grams (after redemptions)
- Shortfall: 500K grams
- Required in ground: 500K × 3 = 1.5M grams
- **We have 10M grams available (massive buffer)**

---

## TWO-TIER REDEMPTION STRUCTURE

### Standard Redemption (Everyone)

- **Minimum:** 31.1 MXGD (1 oz equivalent)
- **Receive:** 1.0 gram per token
- **Fee:** 1%
- **Timeline:** Instant (cash) or 30 days (physical)

Most users redeem this way. Get base value in gold.

### Premium Redemption (Arbitrage Path)

- **Minimum:** 1,000 MXGD
- **Receive:** 1.10 grams per token (full backing)
- **Fee:** 2%
- **Timeline:** 60 days, physical only

This is the arbitrage mechanism. Only makes sense when token trades significantly below intrinsic value.

**Scenario (illustrative):**

Token at $138.00, gold spot ≈ $136.32:

**Standard redemption:**
- 1,000 tokens → 1,000 grams
- 1,000 × $136.32 = $136,319.17
- Fee 1% = $1,363.19
- Net: $134,955.97
- vs cost $138,000.00 ⇒ **Loss/Profit: $-3,044.03**

**Premium redemption:**
- 1,000 tokens → 1,100 grams  
- 1,100 × $136.32 = $149,951.08
- Fee 2% = $2,999.02
- Net: $146,952.06
- vs cost $138,000.00 ⇒ **Profit: $8,952.06**

The premium path creates buying pressure when price drops.

## DEFLATIONARY BUYBACK PROGRAM

**Revenue Allocation from Gold Sales:**

- 60% → Operating costs and expansion
- 15% → Build physical vault reserves
- 15% → Strengthen over-collateralization
- 10% → Token buyback and burn

**Year 1 Example (updated for $4,240.00/oz):**

- Produce 500kg gold
- Sell 250kg as doré: **$34,079,791.36** revenue
- 10% buyback: **$3,407,979.14**
- At ~$136.32/token: buy **25,000 MXGD**
- Burn permanently

**Impact on Ratio:**

Before: 378,800 tokens ÷ 416,680 grams = **1.100** ratio  
After: 353,800 tokens ÷ 416,680 grams = **1.178** ratio

**Every token now backed by MORE gold.**

**5-Year Projection (intrinsic value at flat spot ≈ $136.32/g):**

| Year | Tokens Outstanding | Grams Backing | Ratio | Intrinsic Value* |
|------|-------------------:|--------------:|------:|-----------------:|
| 1 | 378,800 | 416,680 | 1.100 | $149.95 |
| 2 | 1,360,000 | 1,514,800 | 1.114 | $151.86 |
| 3 | 1,345,000 | 1,514,800 | 1.126 | $153.50 |
| 5 | 2,700,000 | 3,078,000 | 1.140 | $155.40 |

*Assuming gold stays flat at ~$136.32/gram.*

## WHY COMPETITORS CAN'T COPY

**For PAXG to match our 10% over-collateralization:**

Cost per token:
- Buy 1.10 grams at $136.32 spot = **$149.95 cost**

Sell price (to compete with MXGD):
- Sell at ~$136.32 (market)

**Result: -$13.63 loss per token**

**We can do it because:**

Cost per token:
- Produce 1.10 grams at ~$16.00/gram = **$17.60**

Sell price:
- Sell at **$129.50** (5% discount)

**Result: +$111.90 per token (86% margin)**

**This is the moat.** Mine ownership enables profitable over-collateralization. Competitors buying gold on market cannot match.

## RISK-ADJUSTED DOWNSIDE

**Gold crashes 20% to ~$109.06/gram:**

**PAXG holder:**
- Token worth ~$109.06
- Loss: -20%

**MXGD holder:**
- Intrinsic value: 1.10 × $109.06 = **$119.96**
- Token likely trades ~$113.96–$116.36 (premium to PAXG)
- Loss: ~-15% (illustrative)
- **10% buffer provides cushion in bear markets**

---

## IMPLEMENTATION COSTS

**Per token:**
- Extra gold: 0.10 grams
- Production cost: 0.10 × $16.00 = $1.60 per token
- On 86% margin, reduces a couple of points
- **Cost: ~2 percentage points of margin**

**On full 3M token issuance:**
- Extra gold needed: 300,000 grams
- Production cost: 300K × $16.00 = $4,800,000.00
- Revenue sensitivity scales with spot; model remains highly profitable at $4,240.00/oz

**This is incredibly cheap differentiation.**

---

## CONCLUSION

**10% over-collateralization is the sweet spot (recalculated at $4,240.00/oz):**

✓ **Creates real differentiation** - MXGD offers 10% more gold than any competitor  
✓ **Enables arbitrage floor** - Price gravitates toward $141.95–$144.95 when it dips  
✓ **Preserves strong margins** - Still **86%** gross margin  
✓ **Impossible to copy** - Competitors would eat **$13.63** losses per token  
✓ **Legally defensible** - Clear commodity characteristics  
✓ **Multiple return drivers** - Gold + premium + deflationary + geological  
✓ **Downside protected** - 10% cushion in bear markets

**10% is Goldilocks - just right.**
