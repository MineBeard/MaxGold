## TOKENOMICS & BUYBACK (UPDATED ILLUSTRATION)

**Year 1 example:** produce 500kg, sell 250kg as doré at $4,240.00/oz → **$34,079,791.36**.  
10% buyback allocation = **$3,407,979.14** → buys ~**25,000** tokens near spot.  
Backing ratio improves from **1.100** to **1.178** (holding 416,680 grams constant).

## PURCHASER RETURNS (UPDATED)

**Year 1 (gold flat):** Ratio rises to 1.13 → intrinsic **$154.04**  
**Year 3 (+15% gold to ~$4,876.00/oz):** Ratio 1.14 → intrinsic **$178.71**  

These replace prior $87/g → $100/g examples.

## DOWNSIDE CASE (UPDATED)

If gold drops 20% to ~$109.06/g:
- PAXG trades ~$109.06 (−20%)
- MXGD intrinsic ~$119.96; secondary price likely **$113.96–$116.36** (roughly ~−15%), due to the 10% over-collateral premium.
