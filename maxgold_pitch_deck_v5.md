## SLIDE 1: THE OPPORTUNITY

### We Run The Mine. We Produce The Gold. We Issue The Token.

**The Problem with Digital Gold Today:**

PAXG and Tether Gold buy gold at $4,340/oz and tokenize it. Zero production margin. No differentiation. Commoditized business model.

**Our Advantage:**

We operate a producing Colorado gold mine with $500/oz all-in costs. We can do things competitors literally cannot afford to do.

**1 MXGD = 1.0 Grams .9999 Fine Gold**
(Growing to 1.10+ grams over time through reserve accumulation)

**Raising:** $50,000,000 via SAFT  
**SAFT Price:** 5% discount to spot (first $25M gets 7%)  
**Minimum:** $250,000  
**Token Delivery:** 120 days from final close

**Current Gold Price:** ~$4,340/oz (~$139.47/gram)  
**Your SAFT Price:** $129.50 - $132.50/gram

---

## SLIDE 2: WHY THIS WORKS (And Why PAXG Can't Copy It)

### The Economics Are Simple

**PAXG's Model:**
- Buy gold at market: $139.47/gram
- Tokenize it
- Sell token at: $139.47/gram  
- **Margin: ~0%** (make money on fees only)

**Our Model:**
- Produce gold at: $16/gram (~$500/oz all-in)
- Tokenize it
- Sell token at: $132.50/gram (5% discount)
- **Margin: $116.50/gram (88%)**

**This $120/gram margin enables:**
- Upfront discounts for SAFT purchasers (5-7%)
- Building reserves over time (growing backing ratio)
- Long-term token holder value appreciation
- Arbitrage protection once reserves reach 1.10:1

**PAXG cannot offer discounts. They cannot over-collateralize. They buy at spot price.**

**We produce at $500/oz. That's the entire moat.**

## SLIDE 3: THE MINE & MILL

### Clay County Mine & Black Eagle Mill - Colorado

**Location:** Central City Mining District, 30 miles west of Denver  
**Operator:** BioMilling LLC (30-year lease, all mineral rights)  
**Type:** Hard rock vein mining + historical tailings

**Documented Reserves:**

Based on 1980s geological drilling programs (not NI 43-101 compliant, but conducted by independent geologists):

- Proven: 35,200 tons
- Probable: 107,900 tons  
- Indicated: 387,000 tons
- **Total: 530,100 tons**

At conservative 0.6 oz/ton traditional recovery: **~318,000 oz in ground**  
Gross value at $4,340/oz: **~$1.4 billion**

With enhanced microbial extraction (targeting 1.0 oz/ton): Potential for significantly higher yields, but projections use traditional recovery only.

**Current Status:**

- Mine is accessible and cleared ("shovel ready")
- Black Eagle Mill on-site, needs 12-month rehabilitation  
- Historical production: $600,000-700,000 in gold at $20/oz (1891-1917)
- Modern equivalent: 30,000-35,000 oz from upper levels only
- Deeper sections remain unexplored

**Why Colorado?**

- Established mining jurisdiction with clear regulations
- Access to infrastructure, power, labor
- 30 miles from Denver (easy logistics)
- Historical production proves geology
- No permitting nightmares (restarting existing operation)

---

## SLIDE 4: REALISTIC PRODUCTION TIMELINE

### We're Not Promising Miracles - Here's The Real Schedule

**Phase 1: Pilot Operations (Months 1-4)**

- Deploy portable crushing equipment
- Set up 20-40 ton/day pilot mill
- Begin microbial extraction testing at scale
- Process accessible ore from existing workings
- **Target: Initial gold production within 90-120 days**
- Expected output: 10-20 oz/day

**Phase 2: Black Eagle Mill Rehabilitation (Months 4-16)**

- 12-month rehab timeline (Franklin's contractor estimate)
- Restore mill structure and ball mill systems
- Install 150 ton/day processing capacity
- Complete safety certifications and engineering
- Parallel: Continue pilot mill operations
- **Target: Full mill operational Month 16**

**Phase 3: Full Production (Month 16 onward - "Year 2")**

Processing capacity: 150 tons/day × 330 operating days = 49,500 tons/year

**Conservative projections (traditional milling only):**
- At 0.5 oz/ton recovery = **24,750 oz/year** (~770 kg)
- At current prices: **$107M gross annual revenue**
- At $500/oz costs: **$95M gross profit** (88% margin)

**Enhanced projections (with microbial technology):**
- At 0.75-1.0 oz/ton = **37,000-50,000 oz/year**
- We don't need this for the model to work, but it's upside

**Key Point:** Our financial model uses conservative traditional mining only. Microbes are bonus, not dependency.

---

## SLIDE 5: MICROBIAL TECHNOLOGY (The Upside, Not The Dependency)

### U.S. Patent 2024/0368725 A1 - Microbial Precious Metal Extraction

**The Technology:**

Proprietary microorganisms that enhance gold recovery from crushed ore. After traditional jaw crusher and ball mill, fine particles are immersed in microbial solution. The microbes capture gold down to nano-particle level, previously unrecoverable.

**Lab & Field Test Results:**

- Traditional recovery: 0.5-0.6 oz/ton from Clay County ore
- With microbes: 0.75-1.0+ oz/ton from same ore  
- **Potential 50-100% yield improvement**

**But Here's What Matters:**

We don't need the microbes to make this work. At traditional 0.5 oz/ton recovery from 150 tons/day, we produce 24,750 oz/year at 88% margins. 

The business is profitable with or without enhanced yields.

**Microbes are the upside. Mine economics are the foundation.**

**BioMilling Relationship:**

Vendor relationship with patent holder. May license or purchase technology. Either way, we control the application at our mill.

## SLIDE 6: TOKEN STRUCTURE - THE "GROWING RESERVE" MODEL

### This Is Different From Every Other Gold Token

**The Standard Model (PAXG, XAUT, Everyone Else):**

- 1 token = 1 gram forever
- They buy gold, they store gold, you redeem 1:1
- No differentiation, no premium, price = spot

**The MaxGold Model - Graduated Over-Collateralization:**

We start at 1:1 like everyone else, but we systematically add gold to reserves over time using a portion of new token sales. The backing ratio increases. Your token becomes worth MORE gold.

**How It Works:**

**Year 1 Launch:**
- Issue 250,000 MXGD tokens
- Backing: 1.0 gram per token (250,000 grams total)
- SAFT purchasers pay $129.50 - $132.50 (5-7% discount)
- Standard redemption: 1.0 gram per token
- No premium redemption yet (we're building reserves)

**Year 2 Scale:**
- Issue additional 500,000 tokens at market price (~$139.47)
- 10% of proceeds ($6.97M) buys ~50,000 grams → reserves
- Total backing: 800,000 grams for 750,000 tokens
- **Ratio increases to 1.067:1**
- Still standard 1.0 gram redemption (ratio not high enough yet)

**Year 3 Mature:**
- Issue another 500,000 tokens at market price
- 10% of proceeds → reserves again (~50,000 grams)
- Total: 1,350,000 grams for 1,250,000 tokens
- **Ratio increases to 1.08:1, heading toward 1.10:1**

**Year 4 Activate Premium:**
- Ratio crosses 1.10:1 threshold
- **NOW enable premium redemption path:**
  - Standard: 1.0 gram per token (1% fee)
  - Premium: Full backing per token (2% fee, 60 days)
- Anti-death-spiral mechanism activates
- Token price gravitates toward $141.95-$144.95 range

**Year 5+:**
- Ratio continues growing: 1.10 → 1.15 → 1.20
- Mine produces 24,750+ oz annually
- More gold continuously added to reserves
- Every existing token holder benefits from ratio growth

**Why This Is Better Than Instant Over-Collateralization:**

- SAFT buyers don't get double discount (fair pricing)
- Cheaper for us initially (no 10% extra gold day one)
- Creates long-term holder loyalty (want to stay for ratio growth)
- Controlled build-up using predictable token sales
- Still prevents death spiral once ratio reaches 1.10:1
- Every token holder benefits from growing reserves

---

## SLIDE 7: THE ANTI-DEATH-SPIRAL MECHANISM

### Once Ratio Hits 1.10:1, Here's What Happens

**The "Death Spiral" Problem:**

Most tokens (including PAXG) can drop below intrinsic value and stay there. If PAXG trades at $130 but gold is $140, there's no natural buying pressure to close the gap. Just slow bleed.

**Our Solution - Arbitrage Floor:**

Once our backing ratio reaches 1.10:1, we enable a "premium redemption" path:

- Standard redemption: 1.0 gram (1% fee, instant)
- Premium redemption: 1.10 grams (2% fee, 60 days, 1000 token minimum)

**Example Scenario:**

Gold spot: $139.47/gram  
MXGD backing: 1.10 grams per token  
Intrinsic value: $153.42

If MXGD drops to $143:

**Arbitrageur's Math:**
- Buy 1,000 MXGD at $143 = $143,000 cost
- Premium redeem for 1,100 grams gold
- 1,100 × $139.47 = $153,417 value
- Minus 2% fee = $150,348
- **Profit: $7,348 (5.1% return in 60 days)**

This creates natural buying pressure. As MXGD drops toward $143, arbitrageurs step in. Price stabilizes around $145-$148 range.

**PAXG cannot do this. They can't offer 1.10 grams per token - it would cost them $153.42 to provide what they sell for $139.47. They'd lose $14 per token.**

**We can do it because we produce gold at $16/gram, not buy at $139.47/gram.**

---

## SLIDE 8: RESERVE ACCUMULATION - NOT BUYBACK/BURN

### We Build Value, We Don't Burn Tokens

**What We're NOT Doing:**

We're not using mine profits to buy back and burn tokens. That model has problems:
- Conflicts with equity investors
- Forces us to buy at potentially inflated prices
- Removes control (profits are unpredictable)
- Can't adjust based on business needs

**What We ARE Doing - Reserve Accumulation:**

Every time we issue new tokens (not from mine operations, from token sales), we use 10% of proceeds to buy physical gold and add it to reserves.

**The Math:**

Year 2: Sell 500,000 new tokens at $139.47 = $69.7M revenue
- 10% = $6.97M → Buy 50,000 grams → Add to reserves
- All existing token holders benefit
- Backing ratio increases for everyone

Year 3: Sell another 500,000 tokens at market
- 10% → reserves again
- Ratio keeps growing

**This Creates Exponential Demand:**

As backing ratio grows, people see: "If I wait, the ratio will be higher but I'll pay more. Better buy now."

Each new issuance increases demand for the next issuance.

**Why This Is Superior:**

- No conflict with equity investors (only from token sales)
- We control timing (issue when we want)
- Don't need to buy back at inflated prices
- Every token holder benefits equally
- Ratio grows predictably
- More gold in reserves = more security
- Creates urgency to buy before next increase

**Example - Year 5:**

Total tokens outstanding: 2,500,000  
Total gold backing: 2,875,000 grams  
Ratio: **1.15:1**

If you're a Year 1 SAFT purchaser:
- Paid: $129.50 for 1.0 gram backing initially
- Year 5: Your token now backed by 1.15 grams
- At $160/gram gold: Intrinsic value = $184
- **Return: 42% from entry, plus ratio appreciation**

## SLIDE 9: TOKEN MECHANICS & REDEMPTION

### ERC-20 Standard, Three Backing Tiers, Two Redemption Paths

**Token Specifications:**

- Standard: ERC-20 on Ethereum
- Ticker: MXGD
- Name: MaxGold
- Backing: 1.0 grams initially, growing to 1.10+ over time

- 25-30% of outstanding tokens backed by physical bars
- Stored in insured third-party vaults (Lloyd's 110% coverage)
- Handles day-to-day redemptions
- Monthly Big 4 audits

**Tier 2 - Over-Collateralization Reserve:**
- The additional gold above 1:1 ratio (once we reach that point)
- Can be physical gold, XAUT, or gold futures
- Built gradually through 10% of token sale proceeds
- Enables premium redemption path
- Replenishes Tier 1 if needed

**Tier 3 - Mine Reserves (Ultimate Backstop):**

- Minimum: 1,000 MXGD  
- Receive: Full backing per token (1.10+ grams)
- Fee: 2%
- Timeline: 60 days, physical only
- This is the arbitrage mechanism

**Smart Contract Security:**

---

## SLIDE 11: FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS (Conservative Case)

### All Numbers Use Traditional Mining Only - No Microbes

**Assumptions:**

- Gold price: Flat at $4,340/oz (~$139.47/gram)
- Production cost: $500/oz (~$16/gram)
- Recovery rate: 0.5 oz/ton (conservative traditional milling)
- Mill capacity Year 2+: 150 tons/day, 330 days/year = 24,750 oz/year

**Year 1 - Pilot Phase:**

Gold production: 2,500 oz (~78 kg) from pilot mill  
Tokenization: 50% → Issue 250,000 MXGD  
Gold sales: 50% sold as doré for operations cash

Revenue:
- Token sales: 250,000 × $132.50 (avg SAFT price) = $33.1M
- Doré sales: 39 kg × $4,340/oz = $5.5M
- **Total: $38.6M**

Costs:
- Pilot mill setup: $3M
- Black Eagle rehab (start): $8M
- Mining operations: $5M
- Overhead: $3M
- Reserve building: $2M
- **Total: $21M**

**Net: $17.6M (46% margin)**

Use of funds: Complete Black Eagle rehab, prepare for full production

**Year 2 - Full Production:**

Gold production: 24,750 oz (~770 kg) at 150 tons/day  
Tokenization: 60% → Issue 467,000 MXGD at market (~$139.47)  
Gold sales: 40% sold as doré

Revenue:
- Token sales: 467,000 × $139.47 = $65.1M
- Doré sales: 308 kg × $139.47/gram = $43M
- **Total: $108.1M**

Costs:
- Full mill operations: $12M
- Mining at scale: $8M
- Overhead: $4M  
- Reserve allocation (10% of token sales): $6.5M
- **Total: $30.5M**

**Net: $77.6M (72% margin)**

Backing ratio increases to ~1.05:1

**Year 3 - Mature Operations:**

Gold production: 24,750 oz (same, steady state)  
Tokenization: 50% → Issue 400,000 MXGD  
Cumulative tokens: 1,117,000

Revenue: $95M (token + doré mix)  
Costs: $28M operations + $4.8M reserve allocation  
**Net: $62M (65% margin)**

Backing ratio increases to ~1.08:1

**Year 5 - Established:**

Cumulative tokens: 2,500,000  
Backing ratio: 1.15:1  
Premium redemption active since Year 4  
Annual revenue: $100M+  
Annual net: $60M+ (60% margin)

**Key Points:**

- These numbers assume FLAT gold price (conservative)
- These numbers assume traditional mining only (no microbe benefit)
- These numbers assume 0.5 oz/ton recovery (low end of range)
- If gold appreciates 15-20% (not unrealistic), all numbers scale up
- If microbes work, production could be 50-100% higher

**This is the conservative base case. Real upside is much higher.**

## SLIDE 14: LEGAL STRUCTURE & RISK MITIGATION

### Why This Is A Commodity Token, Not A Security

**Corporate Structure:**

MaxGold LLC (Token issuer)  
└─ Wholly-owned subsidiary of BioMilling LLC  
   └─ 30-year lease holder: Clay County Mine & Black Eagle Mill

**Commodity Classification - 5 Layer Defense:**

**1. Physical Delivery Rights:**
- Every token redeemable for physical gold
- Not cash-only (that would be security)
- Redemption available from Day 1
- No restrictions on redemption timing

**2. No Profit Expectations From Our Efforts:**
- Token tracks commodity (gold spot price)
- Backing ratio grows from token sales, not our "efforts"
- Standard commodity dynamics
- Not dependent on management skill

**3. Functional Use:**
- Primary use: Own gold digitally
- Trade, store, transfer gold 24/7
- Redeem for physical when desired
- Use in DeFi as collateral
- Not speculative investment

**4. Precedent:**
- PAXG: Not deemed security by SEC (operating since 2019)
- XAUT: Same (operating since 2020)
- No enforcement actions against gold-backed tokens
- Established regulatory acceptance

**5. Howey Test Fails:**
- Investment of money? ✓ Yes (they buy token)
- Common enterprise? ✗ No (they own their specific gold, we don't pool)
- Expectation of profit? ✗ From gold price, not our efforts
- Derived from efforts of others? ✗ They benefit from holding commodity

**Additional Protections:**

- No staking, no yield, no dividends (those would be security features)
- No governance rights (DAO delayed until Year 3+)
- Launch via Regulation S (offshore first, no U.S. marketing initially)
- U.S. market entry only after 12+ months + decentralization
- SAFT structure for pre-launch sales (standard, SEC-accepted)

**Comparison to PAXG:**

We're structurally identical to PAXG with one difference: growing backing ratio. That difference makes us MORE like a commodity (more gold = more commodity), not less.

**Risk Acknowledgment:**

SEC could disagree. If they deem MXGD a security:
- We register as security (Reg A+ available)
- Costs ~$500K and 6 months
- Doesn't kill business, just adds friction
- PAXG/XAUT precedent strongly in our favor

## SLIDE 15: RISKS & HONEST DISCLOSURE

### What Could Go Wrong & How We Mitigate

**Production Risks:**

⚠️ **Black Eagle Mill rehabilitation could exceed 12 months**
- Mitigation: Use pilot mill (operational Month 2)
- Mitigation: Adjust token issuance to match actual production
- Mitigation: Can purchase gold on market temporarily if needed
- Impact: Delays scale-up, doesn't kill business

⚠️ **Mine production could disappoint (geology risk)**
- Mitigation: Conservative 0.5 oz/ton estimates (historically 0.6+)
- Mitigation: 530,100 tons documented reserves (decades of inventory)
- Mitigation: Multiple unexplored vein systems (upside potential)
- Impact: Slower token issuance, model still works at lower volumes

⚠️ **Microbial technology might not scale**
- Mitigation: Model uses traditional mining only (doesn't rely on microbes)
- Mitigation: 24,750 oz/year without microbes is profitable
- Impact: Lose upside, but base case still strong

**Market Risks:**

⚠️ **Gold price could crash**
- Current: $4,340/oz (all-time highs)
- History: Can drop 30%+ in bear markets
- Mitigation: Token tracks commodity (not leveraged)
- Mitigation: Growing backing ratio provides cushion
- Impact: Token value falls with gold, but relative to PAXG we're protected

⚠️ **Low liquidity early on**
- First 6 months: Limited DEX trading only
- Mitigation: $2M+ DEX liquidity provided by us
- Mitigation: Market maker partnerships
- Mitigation: Exchange listings Month 6-9
- Impact: Wider bid-ask spreads early, normalizes over time

**Regulatory Risks:**

⚠️ **SEC could deem MXGD a security**
- Risk: Despite strong commodity case, regulators could disagree
- Mitigation: 5-layer legal defense (see previous slide)
- Mitigation: PAXG/XAUT precedent strongly favors us
- Mitigation: Can register as security if forced (Reg A+)
- Impact: Delays, legal costs, doesn't kill business

⚠️ **Colorado mining regulations could change**
- Mitigation: Established mining district (regulations stable since 1800s)
- Mitigation: Restarting existing operation (not new mine)
- Mitigation: Strong relationships with state regulators
- Impact: Could increase costs, unlikely to shut down operations

**Operational Risks:**

⚠️ **Key person risk (Franklin/John)**
- Mitigation: Experienced mining manager (Stephen Humphray)
- Mitigation: Standard operator agreements
- Mitigation: Hiring CFO/COO to diversify management
- Impact: Transition period if founders leave, operations continue

⚠️ **Smart contract risk**
- Mitigation: Professional audit (CertiK or Trail of Bits)
- Mitigation: Based on battle-tested PAXG/USDC code
- Mitigation: Multi-sig controls, emergency pause function
- Impact: Could lose funds if hacked, insurance partially covers

**Custody Risks:**

⚠️ **Third-party vault risk**
- Mitigation: Lloyd's insurance (110% coverage)
- Mitigation: Monthly Big 4 audits
- Mitigation: Diversified across multiple vault providers
- Impact: If vault fails, insurance covers loss

**Competitive Risks:**

⚠️ **PAXG could try to copy our model**
- Reality: They can't. They don't have mine.
- Reality: They buy gold at $4,340/oz, can't afford over-collateralization
- Impact: Not a real threat

⚠️ **Another mine-backed token could launch**
- Mitigation: First-mover advantage, established liquidity
- Mitigation: Our production cost advantage ($500/oz is exceptionally low)
- Mitigation: Takes years to restart a mine (high barrier to entry)
- Impact: Possible but unlikely, and we'd still have better economics

## SLIDE 16: PURCHASER RETURNS ANALYSIS

### Multiple Return Drivers, Not Just Gold Price

**SAFT Purchaser - 7% Discount Entry ($129.50)**

**Scenario 1 - Conservative (Gold Flat):**
- Gold stays at $4,340/oz (~$139.47/gram) for 5 years
- Token tracks spot, trades at ~$139.47
- Backing ratio grows from 1.0 to 1.15 over 5 years
- Your return: 7.7% from entry discount + ratio appreciation
- **Total: ~8-10% absolute return**

**Scenario 2 - Base Case (Gold Up 15%):**
- Gold rises to $4,990/oz (~$160/gram) over 3 years
- Token tracks spot, trades at ~$160
- Backing ratio grows to 1.08 by Year 3
- Your return: 23.5% from gold + 7.7% from entry = 31.2%
- **Total: ~25-35% in 3 years**

**Scenario 3 - Bull Case (Gold Up 40%):**
- Gold rises to $6,076/oz (~$195/gram) over 5 years
- Token tracks spot, trades at ~$195
- Backing ratio grows to 1.15
- Your return: 50.5% from gold + 7.7% from entry = 58.2%
- Plus: Ratio appreciation adds another 5-10%
- **Total: ~60-70% in 5 years**

**Risk-Adjusted Downside:**

If gold crashes 25% to $3,255/oz (~$104.60/gram):
- PAXG holder: Token worth $104.60, -25% loss
- MXGD holder: Entry at $129.50, current $104.60, -19% loss
- **Your entry discount provides 6% cushion in crash scenario**

Plus: By Year 3+, backing ratio (1.08-1.10) provides additional cushion

**Secondary Market Purchaser (Buys at $139.47 after launch):**

- No entry discount, but benefits from ratio growth
- Conservative case: 5-8% from ratio over 5 years
- Base case: 15-20% from gold + 5-8% from ratio
- Bull case: 40%+ from gold + 10-15% from ratio

**The Key Differentiator:**

PAXG/XAUT holders get gold price only.  
MXGD holders get gold price + ratio appreciation + arbitrage protection.

## SLIDE 20: CLOSING

### This Only Works Because We Own The Mine

**The entire model rests on one fact:**

We produce gold at $500/oz while competitors buy at $4,340/oz.

That $3,840/oz difference enables:
- SAFT discounts (5-7%)
- Reserve accumulation (growing backing ratio)
- Arbitrage protection (premium redemption)
- Long-term holder value creation

**PAXG cannot copy this. Tether Gold cannot copy this.**

They don't have mines. They buy at market price. They have zero margin.

**This is the first and only mine-backed gold token with growing reserves.**

**This is your opportunity to enter at the ground floor.**

**Limited to $50M. First close in 4 weeks.**

## APPENDIX A: KEY TERMS

**SAFT** - Simple Agreement for Future Tokens. Industry standard for pre-launch sales.

**Over-Collateralization** - Backing each token with more than 1:1 gold. We build this gradually.

**Premium Redemption** - Redeem for full backing (1.10+ grams) vs standard (1.0 gram). Creates arbitrage floor.

**Reserve Accumulation** - Using portion of new token sales to buy gold for reserves. Increases backing ratio.

**Three-Tier Backing** - Physical vault (Tier 1) + Reserve gold (Tier 2) + Mine reserves (Tier 3).

**Doré** - Semi-pure gold bars from mine (90-95%) before final refining to .9999 fine.

**Graduated Over-Collateralization** - Start at 1:1, build to 1.10+ over time. Different from instant over-collat.
