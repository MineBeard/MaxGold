## SLIDE 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### We Operate The Mine. We Produce The Gold. We Issue The Token.

**The Problem with Digital Gold Today:**

PAXG and Tether Gold buy gold at market price ($4,275/oz) and tokenize it. Zero production margin. No differentiation.

**Our Advantage:**

We operate a producing Colorado gold mine through BioMilling LLC with all-in costs around $500/oz. We can do things competitors literally cannot afford to do.

**1 MXGD = 1.0 Grams .9999 Fine Gold**
(Growing to 1.10+ grams over time through reserve accumulation)

**Raising:** $50,000,000 via SAFT  
**SAFT Price:** 5% discount to spot (first $25M gets 7%)  
**Minimum:** $250,000  
**Token Delivery:** 120 days from final close

**Current Gold Price:** ~$4,275/oz (~$137.46/gram)  
**Your SAFT Price:** $127.60 - $130.60/gram

---

## SLIDE 2: WHY THIS WORKS (And Why PAXG Can't Copy It)

### The Economics Are Simple

**PAXG's Model:**
- Buy gold at market: $137.46/gram
- Tokenize it
- Sell token at: $137.46/gram  
- **Margin: ~0%** (make money on fees only)

**Our Model:**
- Produce gold at: ~$16/gram (~$500/oz all-in)
- Tokenize it
- Sell token at: $130.60/gram (5% discount)
- **Margin: $114.60/gram (88%)**

**This $121/gram margin enables:**
- Upfront discounts for SAFT purchasers (5-7%)
- Building reserves over time (growing backing ratio)
- Long-term token holder value appreciation
- Arbitrage protection once reserves reach 1.10:1

**PAXG cannot offer discounts. They cannot over-collateralize. They buy at spot price.**

**We produce at $500/oz. That's the entire moat.**

## SLIDE 3: THE MINE & MILL

### Clay County Mine & Black Eagle Mill - Colorado

**Location:** Central City Mining District, Gilpin County, 30 miles west of Denver  
**Operator:** BioMilling LLC (30-year lease, operates all mineral rights)  
**Type:** Hard rock vein mining + historical tailings

**Documented Reserves:**

Based on 1980s geological drilling programs (not NI 43-101 compliant, but conducted by independent geologists):

- Proven: 35,200 tons
- Probable: 107,900 tons  
- Indicated: 387,000 tons
- **Total: 530,100 tons**

At conservative 0.6 oz/ton traditional recovery: **~318,000 oz in ground**  
Gross value at $4,275/oz: **~$1.4 billion**

**Current Status:**

- Mine is accessible and cleared
- Black Eagle Mill on-site, needs 12-month rehabilitation  
- Historical production: $600,000-700,000 in gold at $20/oz (1891-1917)
- Modern equivalent: 30,000-35,000 oz from upper levels only
- Deeper sections remain unexplored

**Why Colorado?**

- Established mining jurisdiction with clear regulations
- Access to infrastructure, power, labor
- 30 miles from Denver (easy logistics)
- Historical production proves geology
- Restarting existing operation (simpler permitting)

---

## SLIDE 4: REALISTIC PRODUCTION TIMELINE

### We're Not Promising Miracles - Here's The Real Schedule

**Phase 1: Pilot Operations (Months 1-4)**

- Deploy portable crushing equipment
- Set up 20-40 ton/day pilot mill
- Begin processing accessible ore from existing workings
- **Target: Initial gold production within 90-120 days**
- Expected output: 10-20 oz/day
- Validates operations while Black Eagle rehabs

**Phase 2: Black Eagle Mill Rehabilitation (Months 4-16)**

- 12-month rehab timeline (contractor estimate)
- Restore mill structure and ball mill systems
- Install 150 ton/day processing capacity
- Complete safety certifications and engineering
- Parallel: Continue pilot mill operations
- **Target: Full mill operational Month 16**

**Phase 3: Full Production (Month 16 onward - "Year 2")**

Processing capacity: 150 tons/day × 330 operating days = 49,500 tons/year

**Conservative projections (traditional milling only):**
- At 0.5 oz/ton recovery = **24,750 oz/year** (~770 kg)
- At current prices: **$105M gross annual revenue**
- At $500/oz costs: **$93M gross profit** (88% margin)

**Enhanced projections (with microbial technology):**
- At 0.75-1.0 oz/ton = **37,000-50,000 oz/year**
- We don't need this for the model to work, but it's upside

**Key Point:** Our financial model uses conservative traditional mining only. Microbes are bonus, not dependency.

## SLIDE 5: TOKEN STRUCTURE - THE "GROWING RESERVE" MODEL

### This Is Different From Every Other Gold Token

**The Standard Model (PAXG, XAUT, Everyone Else):**

- 1 token = 1 gram forever
- They buy gold, they store gold, you redeem 1:1
- No differentiation, no premium, price = spot

**The MaxGold Model - Graduated Over-Collateralization:**

We start at 1:1 like everyone else, but we systematically add gold to reserves over time using a portion of new token sales. The backing ratio increases. Your token becomes worth MORE gold.

**How It Works:**

**Year 1 Launch:**
- Issue 250,000 MXGD tokens
- Backing: 1.0 gram per token (250,000 grams total)
- SAFT purchasers pay $127.60 - $130.60 (5-7% discount)
- Standard redemption: 1.0 gram per token
- No premium redemption yet (we're building reserves)

**Year 2 Scale:**
- Issue additional 500,000 tokens at market price (~$137.46)
- 15% of gross profit ($9.25M) buys ~67,000 grams → reserves
- Produced: 500,000 grams for backing + 67,000 for reserves = 567,000 grams
- Total backing: 817,000 grams for 750,000 tokens
- **Ratio increases to 1.089:1**
- Still standard 1.0 gram redemption (ratio not high enough yet)

**Year 3 Mature:**
- Issue another 500,000 tokens at market price
- 15% of gross profit → reserves again (~67,000 grams)
- Total: 1,384,000 grams for 1,250,000 tokens
- **Ratio: 1.107:1** → Crosses threshold!

**Year 4 Activate Premium:**
- Ratio above 1.10:1 threshold
- **NOW enable premium redemption path:**
  - Standard: 1.0 gram per token (1% fee)
  - Premium: Full backing per token (2% fee, 60 days)
- Anti-death-spiral mechanism activates
- Token price gravitates toward $139-$144 range

**Year 5+:**
- Ratio continues growing: 1.10 → 1.15 → 1.20
- Mine produces 24,750+ oz annually
- More gold continuously added to reserves
- Every existing token holder benefits from ratio growth

**Why This Is Better Than Instant Over-Collateralization:**

- SAFT buyers don't get double discount (fair pricing)
- Cheaper for us initially (no 10% extra gold day one)
- Creates long-term holder loyalty (want to stay for ratio growth)
- Controlled build-up using predictable token sales
- Still prevents death spiral once ratio reaches 1.10:1
- Every token holder benefits from growing reserves

---

## SLIDE 6: THE ANTI-DEATH-SPIRAL MECHANISM

### Once Ratio Hits 1.10:1, Here's What Happens

**The "Death Spiral" Problem:**

Most tokens (including PAXG) can drop below intrinsic value and stay there. If PAXG trades at $130 but gold is $137.46, there's no natural buying pressure to close the gap. Just slow bleed.

**Our Solution - Arbitrage Floor:**

Once our backing ratio reaches 1.10:1, we enable a "premium redemption" path:

- Standard redemption: 1.0 gram (1% fee, instant)
- Premium redemption: 1.10 grams (2% fee, 60 days, 1000 token minimum)

**Example Scenario:**

Gold spot: $137.46/gram  
MXGD backing: 1.10 grams per token  
Intrinsic value: $151.21

If MXGD drops to $141:

**Arbitrageur's Math:**
- Buy 1,000 MXGD at $141 = $141,000 cost
- Premium redeem for 1,100 grams gold
- 1,100 × $137.46 = $151,206 value
- Minus 2% fee = $148,182
- **Profit: $7,182 (5.1% return in 60 days)**

This creates natural buying pressure. As MXGD drops toward $141, arbitrageurs step in. Price stabilizes around $143-$146 range.

**PAXG cannot do this. They can't offer 1.10 grams per token - it would cost them $151.21 to provide what they sell for $137.46. They'd lose $14 per token.**

**We can do it because we produce gold at $16/gram, not buy at $137.46/gram.**

---

## SLIDE 7: RESERVE ACCUMULATION - NOT BUYBACK/BURN

### We Build Value, We Don't Burn Tokens

**What We're NOT Doing:**

We're not using mine profits to buy back and burn tokens. That model has problems:
- Conflicts with equity investors
- Forces us to buy at potentially inflated prices
- Removes control (profits are unpredictable)
- Can't adjust based on business needs

**What We ARE Doing - Reserve Accumulation:**

Every time we issue new tokens, we use 15% of gross profit to produce extra gold and add it to reserves.

**The Mechanism:**

We produce gold at $16/gram. We sell tokens at $130-137/gram. The $114-121 spread is gross profit.

From this profit, we allocate:
- 85% to business operations and expansion
- 15% to producing ADDITIONAL gold for reserves

**Year 2 Example:**

Issue 500,000 new MXGD tokens:

**Revenue side:**
- 500,000 tokens × $137.46 = $68.7M cash received

**Cost side:**
- Need 500,000 grams gold to back these tokens at 1:1
- Produce 500,000 grams at $16/gram = $8M production cost
- Gross profit: $68.7M - $8M = $60.7M

**Allocation:**
- $51.6M (85%) → Operations, expansion, overhead
- $9.1M (15%) → Produce 67,000 extra grams for reserves

**Result:**
- New token holders get their 1:1 backing (500,000 grams)
- Reserve pool grows by 67,000 grams
- All existing token holders benefit from ratio increase
- Total produced: 567,000 grams from 500,000 token sale

**Math check:**

Starting: 250,000 tokens, 250,000 grams (1.0:1)

After Year 2 issuance:
- Tokens: 250,000 + 500,000 = 750,000
- Backing: 250,000 + 500,000 + 67,000 = 817,000 grams
- Ratio: 817,000 ÷ 750,000 = **1.089:1**

After Year 3 issuance (another 500,000 tokens):
- Tokens: 750,000 + 500,000 = 1,250,000
- Backing: 817,000 + 500,000 + 67,000 = 1,384,000 grams
- Ratio: 1,384,000 ÷ 1,250,000 = **1.107:1** → Crosses threshold!

## SLIDE 10: FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS (Conservative Case)

### All Numbers Use Traditional Mining Only - No Microbes

**Assumptions:**

- Gold price: Flat at $4,275/oz (~$137.46/gram)
- Production cost: $500/oz (~$16/gram)
- Recovery rate: 0.5 oz/ton (conservative traditional milling)
- Mill capacity Year 2+: 150 tons/day, 330 days/year = 24,750 oz/year

**Year 1 - Pilot Phase:**

Gold production: 2,500 oz (~78 kg) from pilot mill  
Tokenization: 50% → Issue 250,000 MXGD  
Gold sales: 50% sold as doré for operations cash

Revenue:
- Token sales: 250,000 × $130.60 (avg SAFT price) = $32.7M
- Doré sales: 39 kg × $4,275/oz = $5.4M
- **Total: $38.1M**

Costs:
- Pilot mill setup: $3M
- Black Eagle rehab (start): $8M
- Mining operations: $5M
- Overhead: $3M
- Reserve building: $2M
- **Total: $21M**

**Net: $17.1M (45% margin)**

Use of funds: Complete Black Eagle rehab, prepare for full production

**Year 2 - Full Production:**

Gold production: 24,750 oz (~770 kg) at 150 tons/day  
Tokenization: 60% → Issue 462,000 MXGD at market (~$137.46)  
Gold sales: 40% sold as doré

Revenue:
- Token sales: 462,000 × $137.46 = $63.5M
- Doré sales: 308 kg × $137.46/gram = $42.3M
- **Total: $105.8M**

Costs:
- Full mill operations: $12M
- Mining at scale: $8M
- Overhead: $4M  
- Reserve allocation (15% of token profit): $6.8M
- **Total: $30.8M**

**Net: $75M (71% margin)**

Backing ratio increases to ~1.06:1

**Year 3 - Mature Operations:**

Gold production: 24,750 oz (same, steady state)  
Tokenization: 50% → Issue 385,000 MXGD  
Cumulative tokens: 1,097,000

Revenue: $93M (token + doré mix)  
Costs: $27M operations + $7.2M reserve allocation  
**Net: $59M (63% margin)**

Backing ratio increases to ~1.11:1 → **Premium redemption activates!**

**Year 5 - Established:**

Cumulative tokens: 2,500,000  
Backing ratio: 1.15:1  
Premium redemption active since Year 3  
Annual revenue: $100M+  
Annual net: $60M+ (60% margin)

**Key Points:**

- These numbers assume FLAT gold price (conservative)
- These numbers assume traditional mining only (no microbe benefit)
- These numbers assume 0.5 oz/ton recovery (low end of range)
- If gold appreciates 15-20% (not unrealistic), all numbers scale up
- If microbes work, production could be 50-100% higher

**This is the conservative base case. Real upside is much higher.**

---

## SLIDE 11: MICROBIAL TECHNOLOGY (The Upside, Not The Dependency)

### U.S. Patent 2024/0368725 A1 - Enhanced Gold Recovery

**The Technology:**

Proprietary microorganisms enhance gold recovery from crushed ore. After traditional processing (jaw crusher and ball mill), fine particles are immersed in microbial solution. The microbes capture gold down to nano-particle level, previously unrecoverable.

**Lab & Field Test Results:**

- Traditional recovery: 0.5-0.6 oz/ton from local ore
- With microbes: 0.75-1.0+ oz/ton from same ore  
- **Potential 50-100% yield improvement**

**But Here's What Matters:**

We don't need the microbes to make this work. At traditional 0.5 oz/ton recovery from 150 tons/day, we produce 24,750 oz/year at 88% margins. 

The business is profitable with or without enhanced yields.

**Microbes are the upside. Mine economics are the foundation.**

**Application:**

The microbial process will be applied locally at our operations only. Due to logistics and operational complexity, this is not a technology we plan to license broadly in Year 1-2. Focus is on optimizing our own production first.

**Relationship:**

Vendor relationship with patent holder. May license or purchase technology. Either way, we control the application at our mill.

## SLIDE 14: LEGAL STRUCTURE & RISK MITIGATION

### Why This Is A Commodity Token, Not A Security

**Corporate Structure:**

BioMilling LLC (U.S.)  
└─ Operates Clay County Mine & Black Eagle Mill (30-year lease)  
└─ Produces gold doré for MaxGold

MaxGold LLC (U.S.)  
└─ Issues MXGD tokens  
└─ Purchases gold from BioMilling operations  
└─ Manages token operations and redemptions

Token holders own GOLD (commodity), not equity in either company

**Commodity Classification - 5 Layer Defense:**

**1. Physical Delivery Rights:**
- Every token redeemable for physical gold
- Not cash-only (that would be security)
- Redemption available from Day 1
- No restrictions on redemption timing

**2. No Profit Expectations From Our Efforts:**
- Token tracks commodity (gold spot price)
- Backing ratio grows from token sales, not our "efforts"
- Standard commodity dynamics
- Not dependent on management skill

**3. Functional Use:**
- Primary use: Own gold digitally
- Trade, store, transfer gold 24/7
- Redeem for physical when desired
- Use in DeFi as collateral
- Not speculative investment

**4. Precedent:**
- PAXG: Not deemed security by SEC (operating since 2019)
- XAUT: Same (operating since 2020)
- No enforcement actions against gold-backed tokens
- Established regulatory acceptance

**5. Howey Test Fails:**
- Investment of money? ✓ Yes (they buy token)
- Common enterprise? ✗ No (they own their specific gold, we don't pool)
- Expectation of profit? ✗ From gold price, not our efforts
- Derived from efforts of others? ✗ They benefit from holding commodity

**Additional Protections:**

- No staking, no yield, no dividends (those would be security features)
- No governance rights (DAO delayed until Year 3+)
- Launch via Regulation S (offshore first, no U.S. marketing initially)
- U.S. market entry only after 12+ months + decentralization
- SAFT structure for pre-launch sales (standard, SEC-accepted)

**Comparison to PAXG:**

We're structurally identical to PAXG with one difference: growing backing ratio. That difference makes us MORE like a commodity (more gold = more commodity), not less.

**Risk Acknowledgment:**

SEC could disagree. If they deem MXGD a security:
- We register as security (Reg A+ available)
- Costs ~$500K and 6 months
- Doesn't kill business, just adds friction
- PAXG/XAUT precedent strongly in our favor

## SLIDE 15: RISKS & HONEST DISCLOSURE

### What Could Go Wrong & How We Mitigate

**Production Risks:**

⚠️ **Black Eagle Mill rehabilitation could exceed 12 months**
- Mitigation: Use pilot mill (operational Month 2)
- Mitigation: Adjust token issuance to match actual production
- Mitigation: Can purchase gold on market temporarily if needed
- Impact: Delays scale-up, doesn't kill business

⚠️ **Mine production could disappoint (geology risk)**
- Mitigation: Conservative 0.5 oz/ton estimates (historically 0.6+)
- Mitigation: 530,100 tons documented reserves (decades of inventory)
- Mitigation: Multiple unexplored vein systems (upside potential)
- Impact: Slower token issuance, model still works at lower volumes

⚠️ **Microbial technology might not scale**
- Mitigation: Model uses traditional mining only (doesn't rely on microbes)
- Mitigation: 24,750 oz/year without microbes is profitable
- Impact: Lose upside, but base case still strong

**Market Risks:**

⚠️ **Gold price could crash**
- Current: $4,275/oz (all-time highs)
- History: Can drop 30%+ in bear markets
- Mitigation: Token tracks commodity (not leveraged)
- Mitigation: Growing backing ratio provides cushion
- Impact: Token value falls with gold, but relative to PAXG we're protected

⚠️ **Low liquidity early on**
- First 6 months: Limited DEX trading only
- Mitigation: $2M+ DEX liquidity provided by us
- Mitigation: Market maker partnerships
- Mitigation: Exchange listings Month 6-9
- Impact: Wider bid-ask spreads early, normalizes over time

**Regulatory Risks:**

⚠️ **SEC could deem MXGD a security**
- Risk: Despite strong commodity case, regulators could disagree
- Mitigation: 5-layer legal defense (see previous slide)
- Mitigation: PAXG/XAUT precedent strongly favors us
- Mitigation: Can register as security if forced (Reg A+)
- Impact: Delays, legal costs, doesn't kill business

⚠️ **Colorado mining regulations could change**
- Mitigation: Established mining district (regulations stable since 1800s)
- Mitigation: Restarting existing operation (not new mine)
- Mitigation: Strong relationships with state regulators
- Impact: Could increase costs, unlikely to shut down operations

**Operational Risks:**

⚠️ **Key person risk (Franklin/John)**
- Mitigation: Experienced mining manager (Stephen Humphray)
- Mitigation: Standard operator agreements
- Mitigation: Hiring CFO/COO to diversify management
- Impact: Transition period if founders leave, operations continue

⚠️ **Smart contract risk**
- Mitigation: Professional audit (CertiK or Trail of Bits)
- Mitigation: Based on battle-tested PAXG/USDC code
- Mitigation: Multi-sig controls, emergency pause function
- Impact: Could lose funds if hacked, insurance partially covers

**Custody Risks:**

⚠️ **Third-party vault risk**
- Mitigation: Lloyd's insurance (110% coverage)
- Mitigation: Monthly Big 4 audits
- Mitigation: Diversified across multiple vault providers
- Impact: If vault fails, insurance covers loss

**Competitive Risks:**

⚠️ **PAXG could try to copy our model**
- Reality: They can't. They don't have mine.
- Reality: They buy gold at $4,275/oz, can't afford over-collateralization
- Impact: Not a real threat

⚠️ **Another mine-backed token could launch**
- Mitigation: First-mover advantage, established liquidity
- Mitigation: Our production cost advantage ($500/oz is exceptionally low)
- Mitigation: Takes years to restart a mine (high barrier to entry)
- Impact: Possible but unlikely, and we'd still have better economics

## SLIDE 16: PURCHASER RETURNS ANALYSIS

### Multiple Return Drivers, Not Just Gold Price

**SAFT Purchaser - 7% Discount Entry ($127.60)**

**Scenario 1 - Conservative (Gold Flat):**
- Gold stays at $4,275/oz (~$137.46/gram) for 5 years
- Token tracks spot, trades at ~$137.46
- Backing ratio grows from 1.0 to 1.15 over 5 years
- Your return: 7.7% from entry discount + ratio appreciation
- **Total: ~8-10% absolute return**

**Scenario 2 - Base Case (Gold Up 15%):**
- Gold rises to $4,916/oz (~$158/gram) over 3 years
- Token tracks spot, trades at ~$158
- Backing ratio grows to 1.08 by Year 3
- Your return: 23.8% from gold + 7.7% from entry = 31.5%
- **Total: ~25-35% in 3 years**

**Scenario 3 - Bull Case (Gold Up 40%):**
- Gold rises to $5,985/oz (~$192/gram) over 5 years
- Token tracks spot, trades at ~$192
- Backing ratio grows to 1.15
- Your return: 50.4% from gold + 7.7% from entry = 58.1%
- Plus: Ratio appreciation adds another 5-10%
- **Total: ~60-70% in 5 years**

**Risk-Adjusted Downside:**

If gold crashes 25% to $3,206/oz (~$103/gram):
- PAXG holder: Token worth $103, -25% loss
- MXGD holder: Entry at $127.60, current $103, -19% loss
- **Your entry discount provides 6% cushion in crash scenario**

Plus: By Year 3+, backing ratio (1.08-1.10) provides additional cushion

**Secondary Market Purchaser (Buys at $137.46 after launch):**

- No entry discount, but benefits from ratio growth
- Conservative case: 5-8% from ratio over 5 years
- Base case: 15-20% from gold + 5-8% from ratio
- Bull case: 40%+ from gold + 10-15% from ratio

**The Key Differentiator:**

PAXG/XAUT holders get gold price only.  
MXGD holders get gold price + ratio appreciation + arbitrage protection.

## SLIDE 20: CLOSING

### This Only Works Because We Operate The Mine

**The entire model rests on one fact:**

We produce gold at $500/oz while competitors buy at $4,275/oz.

That $3,775/oz difference enables:
- SAFT discounts (5-7%)
- Reserve accumulation (growing backing ratio)
- Arbitrage protection (premium redemption)
- Long-term holder value creation

**PAXG cannot copy this. Tether Gold cannot copy this.**

They don't operate mines. They buy at market price. They have zero margin.

**This is the first and only mine-operated gold token with growing reserves.**

**This is your opportunity to enter at the ground floor.**

**Limited to $50M. First close in 4 weeks.**

---

## APPENDIX A: KEY TERMS

**SAFT** - Simple Agreement for Future Tokens. Industry standard for pre-launch sales.

**Over-Collateralization** - Backing each token with more than 1:1 gold. We build this gradually.

**Premium Redemption** - Redeem for full backing (1.10+ grams) vs standard (1.0 gram). Creates arbitrage floor.

**Reserve Accumulation** - Using portion of gross profit to produce extra gold for reserves. Increases backing ratio.

**Three-Tier Backing** - Physical vault (Tier 1) + Reserve gold (Tier 2) + Mine reserves (Tier 3).

**Doré** - Semi-pure gold bars from mine (90-95%) before final refining to .9999 fine.

**Graduated Over-Collateralization** - Start at 1:1, build to 1.10+ over time. Different from instant over-collat.
